## Instructions

1. Add/edit a one-sentence teaser in the frontmatter.
2. Add 3-4 capitalized tags in the front matter.
3. Convert all inline links to footnotes. Footnotes do not require a heading. Each footnote must be a link where the text is the title of the URL and the URL is the link destination.
