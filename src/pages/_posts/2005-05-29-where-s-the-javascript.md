Every once in a while people ask me, &#8220;if you&#8217;re so into JavaScript, why isn&#8217;t there any on your site?&#8221; The truth is, my point in making this site was first and foremost to make it accessible and completely <acronym title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> compliant. Simplicity, I thought, was what I would spend my time on.

After seeing the cool stuff that <a title="ForgetFoo" rel="external" href="http://www.forgetfoo.com">Foo</a> and other people have on their sites, I&#8217;m hoping to find some time to redesign my site to use more JavaScript and <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">AJAX</acronym> soon. Don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;ll be anytime soon, but it&#8217;s on my list of things to do.
