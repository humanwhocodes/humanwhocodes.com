I&#8217;m home a bit early from the <a title="The Rich Web Experience" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com">Rich Web Experience</a> today, having sat through only two presentations. I&#8217;m exhausted, after having gotten home past midnight last night, and given that my talk tomorrow is at 8:30am, I thought it wise to get home and get to sleep early.

I sat through <a title="Looks Good, Works Well" rel="external" href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/">Bill Scott</a>&#8216;s presentation on User Interface Anti-patterns, where he shows examples of bad user interface design on the Web. This was at times funny and at times sad (realizing that a lot of the mistakes were being made by Yahoo! properties). Still, it&#8217;s sometimes helpful to show examples of what not to do instead of what to do; there&#8217;s value in recognizing that you&#8217;re completely messing up because you&#8217;re doing something that someone else specifically said was dumb.

I&#8217;m bummed that I missed <a title="Slides from my &quot;Standards Heresy&quot; Talk" rel="external" href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=622">Alex Russell&#8217;s talk</a> about standards and pragmatism. He echoes a lot of the sentiments I&#8217;ve <a title="Standards in Context" rel="internal" href="{{site.url}}/archive/2007/7/456">written about previously</a>. Sadly, I&#8217;m fighting a cold and my body just wouldn&#8217;t allow me to get up early enough to sit in, but I whole-heartedly agree with everything he talked about.

I did get a chance to <a title="WebTide" rel="external" href="http://www.webtide.com">Greg Wilkin</a>&#8216;s excellent presentation on Comet. I wrote a chapter on Comet in <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProfessional-Ajax-2nd-Nicholas-Zakas%2Fdp%2F0470109491%2F&tag=nczonline-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Ajax, 2nd Edition</a>, but I still learned a lot from this talk. In the year since I wrote that chapter, there have been some serious advances, and Greg&#8217;s work on the Jetty web server in relation to its Comet capabilities is really impressive. I had the opportunity to catch up with <a title="Greg Wilkins and Joe Walker" rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nzakas/1343481411/">Greg (and Joe Walker)</a> after the session to talk briefly about other Comet-related stuff, like <a title="HTML 5: Server-sen Events" rel="external" href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-server-sent-events.html">server-sent events</a>. They&#8217;ve both done work that could really make server-sent events (currently only implemented in Opera 9.02 and higher) something to keep an eye on in the future (shameless plug: server-sent events are also covered <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProfessional-Ajax-2nd-Nicholas-Zakas%2Fdp%2F0470109491%2F&tag=nczonline-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Ajax, 2nd Edition</a>).

Jesse James Garrett also stopped by to do a keynote talk after lunch (always a tough crowd). He did a great talk on user experience and why more isn&#8217;t always more. I also got to speak to him briefly afterwards and thanked him for coining the term &#8220;Ajax&#8221; so I could sell some books.

I&#8217;ve had a great time the past two days and there&#8217;s one day left. If you&#8217;re not at this event, make sure you&#8217;re at the next one.
