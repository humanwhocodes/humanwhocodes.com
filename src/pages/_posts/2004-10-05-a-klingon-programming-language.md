The strange things you can find on the Internet. Just received <a title="Var'aq - A Warrior's Programming Language" rel="external" href="https://www.geocities.com/connorbd/varaq/">this link</a> from a buddy. At this humble GeoCities site, someone has started the specifications for a programming language called Var'aq, which the author describes as, &#8220;designed mostly just to be used for programming things like command displays and high-level control systems&#8221;. The page hasn't been updated in a year, but there are specifications about the fictional language.

Perhaps scarier is the <a title="KDE i18n Klingon" rel="external" href="https://unixcode.org/kde-i18n-klingon/">KDE i18n Klingon</a> project, which can be used to add Klingon language support to <acronym title="Konquerer Desktop Environment">KDE</acronym>.
