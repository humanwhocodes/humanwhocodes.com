Every once in a while, the <a title="YUI Blog" rel="external" href="http://www.yuiblog.com">YUI blog</a> posts an article about someone who&#8217;s using the <a title="Yahoo! User Interface Library" rel="external" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI Library</a> in production. But they missed one. It seems that <a title="Google using YUI grids css" rel="external" href="http://www.zachleat.com/web/2007/04/05/google-using-yui-grids-css/">Google is using it</a> on the customized homepage. I guess that&#8217;s a compliment? <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
