It&#8217;s been an incredibly busy year with work and writing, so I&#8217;ve purposely kept speaking engagements to a minimum. I will, however, be speaking at two events coming up:

  * <a title="The Rich Web Experience - West" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/san_jose/2008/09/index.html">The Rich Web Experience &#8211; West</a>: September 8-10. I&#8217;m going to have four sessions at RWE (details at the site), so I&#8217;ll be running around like crazy. It was a great time last year and I can&#8217;t wait for this year.
  * <a title="The Ajax Experience - West" rel="external" href="http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/">The Ajax Experience</a>: September 29-October 1. I have two sessions, one entitled Enterprise JavaScript Error Handling and another about Test Driven Development with YUI Test. This will be my first time at the conference&#8230;combine that with a trip back to Boston and it makes for a fun end of September.

I really enjoy going to conferences like these, so please, stop me and introduce yourself if you see me walking around. Hope to see you all at either or both events.
