As many of you know, I've had some reviewers signed up to take a look at <a title="Pre-order Professional JavaScript For Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764579088/qid=1105716020/sr=8-3/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl14/102-6730764-4189761?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Professional JavaScript</a> before it came out. I was blown away by when I saw this posted on <a title="XWeb Version 5" rel="external" href="http://www.wdonline.com">Jeremy's site</a>, who has been reviewing a pre-release version of the book:

> I started up the reading of Nicholas Zakas' book *Professional JavaScript* that is going to come out later this year. I'm through chapter 13, and I love this book. Zakas has a thorough understanding of JavaScript, and does a very good job of explaining the language. I've read many JavaScript books, and this one is the best by far. It will replace my loved *JavaScript Bible* as reference. If you use JavaScript, get this book!

All I can say is wow. To be able to replace another JavaScript book, especially one as well-known and prominent as the *JavaScript Bible*, on anyone's desk is such an honor. I really hope that others find the book as useful as Jeremy.
