I have a new favorite development environment: <a href="https://www.eclipse.org" target="_blank">Eclipse</a>. It really is a unique approach to creating Java applications. What I like the most is the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/swt/" target="_blank">SWT</a>, which is an alternative to <a href="https://java.sun.com/products/jfc/" target="_blank">Swing</a>. It runs so much faster than Swing, mostly because of the unique way that it handles rendering the UI components. It could use a little more documentation, but otherwise, Eclipse has definitely gained favor from me.
