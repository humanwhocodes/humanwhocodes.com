On my long search for some co-authors on the upcoming <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">AJAX</acronym> book, I have decided on one so far. That one is <a title="WDOnline" rel="external" href="http://www.wdonline.com">Jeremy McPeak</a>, the author of <a title="XParser" rel="external" href="http://www.wdonline.com/javascript/xparser/">XParser</a> and <a title="FooReader.Net" rel="external" href="http://reader.wdonline.com/">FooReader.Net</a>. What made Jeremy an attractive author candidate was really quite simple. First, he had several articles written at <a title="AlphaFilter" rel="external" href="http://www.alphafilter.com">AlphaFilter</a> that he pointed me to as writing samples (these were well-written), and second, he wrote XParser and FooReader.Net, both of which are demonstrable and clearly explained on his site. These showed that not only does he know what he&#8217;s doing, but he&#8217;s also able to explain it to other people. Both of these are extremely important in writing a book.

Now, the hunt isn&#8217;t over yet, I&#8217;m still looking for at least one more co-author to help with this book. For those of you who have sent samples and ideas, I&#8217;m still going over them. Please don&#8217;t take it personally if I don&#8217;t choose you, I know the type of person I need to be able to deliver a quality book on schedule. You have to be easy to work with, able to take criticism, detail-oriented, a good writer, a good developer, and be willing to spend a lot of time over the next four months working on this. If this sounds like you, [contact me][1].
