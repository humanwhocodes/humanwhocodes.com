I don&#8217;t often blog about work, but in this case, I&#8217;m making an exception. Today is my last day at MatrixOne as I have accepted a position at <a title="VistaPrint" rel="external" href="http://www.vistaprint.com">VistaPrint</a>. It&#8217;s going to be a tough transition since I&#8217;ve worked with some of the people at MatrixOne for about five years, and I&#8217;m going to a company where I don&#8217;t know anybody. However, I felt that this decision was best for my personal career growth. I look forward to the new challenges that will await me at VistaPrint and wish MatrixOne the best of luck in all of their future endeavors.
