I decided to punch my name into <a title="A9" rel="external" href="http://www.a9.com">A9</a> today to figure out more about how it works. I don't know what caused me to search through the Books, but I did, and low and behold I found my name referenced in a book!

The book is called *Web Application Design Handbook : Best Practices for Web-Based Software* (Morgan Kaufmann, ISBN 1558607528) and there, on page 621 is a reference to <a title="Make Life Easy With Autocomplete Textboxes" rel="external" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/1220">my article about autocomplete textboxes</a>! Seems sort of silly to be so excited about it, considering that my own book will be out early next year and will definitely have my name on it, but this sort of makes me feel &#8220;legitimate&#8221; in the JavaScript world. <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
