This week I was scheduled to give a brand new talk at YUIConf entitled, <cite>JavaScript APIs you&#8217;ve never heard of (and some you have)</cite>. Unfortunately, a scheduling conflict means that I won&#8217;t be able to attend. So instead of letting the work of putting together a brand-= new talk go to waste (or otherwise be delayed) I decided to put together a screencast of the talk. This is my first time doing a screencast so I would love some feedback. Here&#8217;s the description of the talk:

The number of JavaScript APIs has exploded over the years, with a small subset of those APIs getting all the attention. While developers feverishly work on Web sockets and canvas, it&#8217;s easy to overlook some smaller and quite useful APIs. This talk uncovers the &#8220;uncool&#8221; JavaScript APIs that most people have never heard of and yet are widely supported by today&#8217;s browsers. You&#8217;ll learn tips and tricks for working with the DOM and other types of data that you can use today.

The screencast is embedded below and the slides are available on [Slideshare][1].



(Yes, my voice is a bit hoarse.)
