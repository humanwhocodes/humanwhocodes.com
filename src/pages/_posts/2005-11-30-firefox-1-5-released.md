So Firefox 1.5 was finally released today and is available for download over at <a title="Mozilla Corporation" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.com">Mozilla&#8217;s new home</a>. Once again, Mozilla managed to outpace Microsoft in releasing a significant to update their Web browser.

Of course, while very cool, developers are now left in a bit of a conundrum. Firefox 1.5 has more features and support for more standards than other browsers, meaning that if you use them you&#8217;ll be automatically alienating the remaining 90% of Internet users. While I&#8217;d love to be able to start using things like <acronym title="ECMAScript for XML">E4X</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>3, the reality is that not enough browsers support them. So while it&#8217;s going to be cool to play with the new technologies, we developers will still be forced to either create two paths or come up with some sort of graceful degradation on top of the usual browser checking that we already do.
