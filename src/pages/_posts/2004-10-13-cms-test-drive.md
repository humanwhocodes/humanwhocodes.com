You know how annoying it is when you&#8217;re trying to decide between all of the open source <acronym title="Content Management Systems">CMS</acronym> systems? You need to go and install it, configure it, and then try it out to see if it suits your needs. What a hassle! This is the main reason I decided to write my own that I knew would do everything I needed it to do. Now I might have to reconsider.

<a title="OpenSourceCMS.com" rel="external" href="http://www.opensourcecms.com">OpenSourceCMS.com</a> does all of the heavy-lifting for you: it has installed dozens of <acronym title="Content Management Systems">CMS</acronym> systems that are available to try with demo logins. You can do anything you want to the system because after an hour, all of your data is erased. This ingenious system allows you to really do all you can do with a <acronym title="Content Management Systems">CMS</acronym> package without worry about installation or configuration. I&#8217;m certainly going to be spending a lot of time on that site.
