Just downloaded the new version of <a rel="external" href="http://www.xmlspy.com">XML Spy</a>, XML Spy 2005. I&#8217;ve been a big fan of XML Spy over the years and have used it since version 3.0. While I&#8217;m appalled by the drastic increase in price (used to be around $200 for the Professional version), they&#8217;ve really made some great developments in this version.

First, the <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</acronym> debugger is improved over the last version. How did I ever get along without this thing? Plus, there&#8217;s support for XQuery and <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</acronym> 2.0.

My favorite new feature, though, is the <a rel="external" href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plugin. I&#8217;ve been using Eclipse for Java development and XML Spy for <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> development, it&#8217;s so nice to be able to use the powerful XML Spy interface from within Eclipse so I don&#8217;t need to switch applications. While the plugin isn&#8217;t as full-featured as I had hoped (no support for XML Spy projects, for example), it&#8217;s a great step forward. I&#8217;m hoping the next version is even better.
