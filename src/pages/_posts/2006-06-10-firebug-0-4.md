The next generation of JavaScript debugging is upon us, and it&#8217;s name is <a title="FireBug" rel="external" href="http://www.joehewitt.com/software/firebug/">FireBug</a>. For the uninitiated, FireBug is an addon for Firefox that makes developing JavaScript easier. Besides a new JavaScript debugger with breakpoint support, it allows you to write debugging info to a console window, evaluate JavaScript in a command line (not unlike <a rel="internal" href="/downloads">Eureka</a> for IE), monitor the contents of <acronym title="XMLHttpRequest">XHR</acronym> calls, inspect the <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> structure of a page, and determine the actual styles being applied to elements. This little gem will save you a lot of development time when used regularly. I highly recommend it.
