So I finally got my copy of Visual C# .Net last week and started playing around with it. As a Java programmer, it was fairly easy to pick up the basic idea to get a simple program working. A lot of the syntax for C# is a mix of C, C++, and Java, all of which I&#8217;ve worked with previously.

I&#8217;m very impressed with the bringing along of powerful C++ functionality such as operator overrides, which I sorely missed when using Java. I&#8217;m not so thrilled at Microsoft&#8217;s insistance on using Pascal case for everything as I much prefer the Java convention of Pascal case for classes and camel case for everything else. I&#8217;ll get used to it, I just find it annoying.

I&#8217;m a bit disappointed in the Visual Studio .Net C# editor. After using <a title="Eclipse" rel="external" href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> for Java development, Visual Studio falls far short of my expectations. The code completion and code insight is shaky at best and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any background compiling for instant feedback as to what will and won&#8217;t work.

So I guess my initial reaction is that the language itself is cool, but the tools built around it need some work.
