I've been so busy lately that I've forgotten to mention a few writings. Many of you will remember that I started out writing articles on various web sites before moving on to books. I've always felt a strong inclination towards writing online articles because they're available via a quick search. So, I decided to contribute some ideas to the <a title="YUI Blog" rel="external" href="http://www.yuiblog.com">YUI Blog</a>, where Yahoo! developers share insights and techniques used on some of the most-visited web sites on the Internet. Here's my first two posts:

  * <a title="Downshift Your Code" rel="external" href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/07/09/downshift-your-code/">Downshift Your Code</a> &#8211; explains how to throttle processing so as not to overload the browser.
  * <a title="Who's Got Style?" rel="external" href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/07/style/">Who's Got Style?</a> &#8211; describes how to dynamically insert <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> code into a document and have the changes reflected across all browsers.
