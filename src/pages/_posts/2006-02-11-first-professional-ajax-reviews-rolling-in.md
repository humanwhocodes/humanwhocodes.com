I was curious to see when the first reviews would start appearing for <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0471777781%2F">Professional Ajax</a>. Today, I found two.

The first comes from <a title="ForgetFoo" rel="external" href="http://www.forgetfoo.com">Foo</a>, who <a title="Review: Ajax Professional" rel="external" href="http://www.forgetfoo.com/?blogid=5700">seemed to like it</a>. I consider it a great compliment when people <a title="FooComment Checker" rel="external" href="http://www.forgetfoo.com/?blogid=5702">get inspiration</a> from stuff I write. I&#8217;ve been inspired by many people, as I believe software is a community process, whether we want to admit it or not.

The other review was posted to the <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0471777781%2F">Amazon</a> page. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a pretty stellar review:

> There are only a handful of books out there, and this book is the best one so far. I know, because I have browsed through them all. Where as other books talk a lot in detail about the browser level AJAX process, most of them fail to explain [in detail] how to make AJAX technologies work with server-side scripts. That&#8217;s where this book is different; there&#8217;s plenty of PHP code with most AJAX examples to show readers how the whole process works.
> 
> The first few chapters have enough information to get a novice started with AJAX. And if you know your html and web development already, you&#8217;d be AJAXifying your sites within hours. I highly recommend this book.

Pretty nice, I hope others like it too!
