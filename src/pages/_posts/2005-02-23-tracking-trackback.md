One of the features I&#8217;ve always been interested in is Trackback, allowing others to say &#8220;hey, I&#8217;m talking about you over here!&#8221; Since I&#8217;m a do-it-yourself kinda guy and decided to build my own blogging system instead of using some of the more popular ones, I&#8217;ve been adding features little by little (as I&#8217;m sure many of you have noticed). Since I plan on redesigning this site sometime soon (fingers crossed), I&#8217;m now at the point where I want to consider adding more features, and Trackback is one of them.

After doing some searching, I came across the <a title="Trackback Technical Specification" rel="external" href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/mttrackback">specification</a> written up by <a title="Movable Type" rel="external" href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>, which is very helpful in determining how I&#8217;m going to implement it here. The technical implementation seems pretty straightforward&#8230;I just need to decide how to represents the Trackbacks. I&#8217;ve seen some sites that insert them as though they were comments and others that list them out separately. Not sure which approach to take yet, but I&#8217;ll sure have some fun playing around with it.
