One of the features I've always been interested in is Trackback, allowing others to say &#8220;hey, I'm talking about you over here!&#8221; Since I'm a do-it-yourself kinda guy and decided to build my own blogging system instead of using some of the more popular ones, I've been adding features little by little (as I'm sure many of you have noticed). Since I plan on redesigning this site sometime soon (fingers crossed), I'm now at the point where I want to consider adding more features, and Trackback is one of them.

After doing some searching, I came across the <a title="Trackback Technical Specification" rel="external" href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/mttrackback">specification</a> written up by <a title="Movable Type" rel="external" href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>, which is very helpful in determining how I'm going to implement it here. The technical implementation seems pretty straightforward&#8230;I just need to decide how to represents the Trackbacks. I've seen some sites that insert them as though they were comments and others that list them out separately. Not sure which approach to take yet, but I'll sure have some fun playing around with it.
