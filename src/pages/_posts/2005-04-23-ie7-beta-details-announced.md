A few details were announced about the upcoming Internet Explorer 7 Beta over at the <a title="IE7 beta - a few details" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/04/22/410963.aspx">IEBlog</a>. It seems that the cries of the developers have been heard as the team announced <acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym> transparency support and improved <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> support. It seems that this next version of the browser won't simply be another security patch, but an actual upgrade with new features as well.
