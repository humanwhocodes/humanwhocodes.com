Every once in a while, you hear a story that makes you say, "that can't be real." This one falls into that category. Apparently, the <acronym title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</acronym> of <a href="http://www.opera.com" rel="external" title="Opera">Opera</a> said if the newest version of their browser, version 8, was downloaded more than a million times in four days that he would swim across the Atlantic Ocean to America. Whether he intended this as a sign of jubilation and excitement or not, downloads surpassed the one million mark and he is now <a href="http://www.opera.com/swim/" rel="external" title="The 1 Million Download Challenge">preparing for the swim</a>. And you thought the days of silly corporate antics were gone!
