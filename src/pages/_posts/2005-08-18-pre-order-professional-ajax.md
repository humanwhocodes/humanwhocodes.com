So I came across a site called <a title="The Strange Zen of JavaScript" rel="external" href="http://jszen.blogspot.com">The Strange Zen of JavaScript</a> that mentioned several upcoming <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> books. Low and behold, one of them was Professional Ajax, which is apparently already available for <a title="Pre-order Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0471777781/">pre-order at Amazon.com</a>! Ironically enough, it looks like some people have already pre-ordered it because it&#8217;s already listed in the overall books list. Why is the author always the last to know?

**Update:** <a title="Jim Minatel's Wrox Book Editor Blog" rel="external" href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com">Jim</a> says that if you hold off on ordering, you should be able to get a 34% discount once Amazon updates with more book information.
