One of the things I don&#8217;t cover in <a title="Pre-order Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764579088/qid=1105481108/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-9733195-7492141?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">my book</a> is programming games in JavaScript. That should come as no surprise, since there really isn&#8217;t anything &#8220;professional&#8221; or practical about it. However, I do find it amazing what creative people have done with JavaScript to make games.

There&#8217;s <a title="An Introduction to Game Programming with JavaScript" rel="external" href="http://www.devx.com/webdev/10MinuteSolution/27134?trk=DXRSS_LATEST">an article</a> over at <a title="DevX" rel="external" href="http://www.devx.com">DevX</a> explaining some of the basics of game programming using JavaScript. An interesting read, indeed. I also found an old, but still relevant article describing how to <a title="JavaScript Extended Project - Pacman" rel="external" href="http://richardbowles.tripod.com/javascript/assignments/pacman/project1.htm">program Pac-man</a> in JavaScript. Check out the following links for some cool JavaScript games:

  * <a title="JavaScript Games" rel="external" href="http://javascript.internet.com/games/">JavaScript Games at Internet.com</a>
  * <a title="JavaScript Tetris" rel="external" href="http://gosu.pl/demo/JsTetris/Tetris.html">JavaScript Tetris</a>

It&#8217;s very cool that you can program games in JavaScript&#8230;maybe someday I&#8217;ll have to give it a try.
