I'm probably the last one to blog about the <a title="IE7 Has Tabs" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/05/16/417732.aspx">announcement</a> that Internet Explorer 7 will support tabs natively. The reason is that I don't think it's that big of an announcement. To me, it's like saying, &#8220;IE7 will have a minimize button&#8221; or &#8220;IE7 will have a statusbar.&#8221; In my mind, this is the dinkiest little feature they could add that should have already been there.

I'm on the side of those who posted comments on this one: what about the standards support. Granted, I'm happy there will be tabs&#8230;finally&#8230;but that's something that any hack programmer with Visual Basic could make for themselves. What we really needs is better standards support, period.
