Oh how the drama keeps unfolding! The person who posted the one-star review to me over at Amazon.com had his first review removed (I'm not sure why). In any event, &#8220;Anonymous Coward&#8221; has posted another review, this one longer, about how horrible the book is. I find it very funny that someone would hate my book so much as to post not one but two negative reviews at Amazon suggesting readers buy someone else's book.

It's also funny how he (I'm assuming it's a he) says I've done such a horrible job writing the code and the book. Apparently, he never bothered to see that each and every code example in the book is available for download and is working properly. Yes, the technical editing leaves something to be desired, but that wasn't my job. My job was to write it.

I'm also fairly amused at how he &#8220;uncovered&#8221; that zInherit is actually written by me. Good job, that was certainly a tough thing to figure out. I'm sorry I didn't mention in the book that I wrote it, but I honestly didn't think it was that important. Yeah, you certainly wouldn't want to trust the JavaScript of someone who wrote a book and has written JavaScript components currently in use by major corporations like GE, Phillips, and Siemens. Good thing he sniffed me out as a fraud.

I really need to stop reading these Amazon reviews, as it has become clear that some people have serious ulterior motives with them. Hey, *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* is a fine book, I won't knock it. Undoubtedly, it has fewer mistakes, but I'd expect that considering it's in its fourth edition. I'm sure all the kinks would be worked out of mine by a fourth edition as well (hopefully sooner).

So, Anonymous Coward, I hope you're enjoying your public beratement of my book. It has definitely hurt my sales&#8230;okay, maybe not. Enough people still seem to find it useful and helpful despite its technical problems. To those people I promise more quality work from me in the future.
