It seems now that the Professional JavaScript book has been out for a while, people are finally starting to get it. I always intended it to be a guide for programmers, not a guide for graphic designers who wanted to add interactivity to their Web sites. Another person who got it is the <a title="Focus on JavaScript" rel="external" href="http://javascript.about.com">JavaScript Guide</a> at <a title="about.com" rel="external" href="http://www.about.com">about.com</a>, who posted a <a title="Professional Javascript for Web Developers Review" rel="external" href="http://javascript.about.com/od/reviews/gr/jswebdev.htm">good review</a> of the book. I particularly like this line:

> This is the perfect book on Javascript for someone who has a programming background.

Exactly!
