It&#8217;s taken me a bit, but I&#8217;ve finally coverted my blog over to use [WordPress][1]. Since I started this blog almost 8 years ago, I&#8217;ve managed it on a custom-written content management system. I wrote everything from scratch including the database schema, spam precautions, and tagging system. This past month, I finally reached the point where I decided that I no longer wanted to maintain my own CMS. It was a pain in the ass to add new features and I really just wanted to focus on writing. Thus, I began the arduous process of converting to WordPress.

The biggest issue I faced was importing my custom database tables into WordPress. I had to put my database admin hat back on, examine the WordPress tables and my own, and then figure out how to get my data converted. Thankfully, I was able to do this without too much hassle. This was mostly due to the fact that my tables were setup in a very similar way to WordPress, which shocks me because databases are certainly not my strong suit. Maybe some of my college database class actually sunk in. <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

I have the same web site design, with a few things missing because I haven&#8217;t had time to make the changes. I really want to spend time redesigning the entire site in the near future, but for now, this will do. You&#8217;ll also note that I&#8217;ve removed the CAPTCHA question from comment forms. Since I have Akismet running now, I&#8217;m going to assume that it&#8217;s good enough to capture spam comments. If I see an increasing number of spam comments, then I&#8217;ll put the CAPTCHA back.

Other than that, you shouldn&#8217;t notice much difference between the old and new sites. All the old links should still work, including individual posts and RSS feeds. That&#8217;s all for now, carry on.
