The subject of blog comment spam has been talked about a lot recently&#8230;I haven't had to worry since I don't really seem to illicit many comments (::shrugs::), but I have actually received spam through my <a title="Contact Me" rel="internal" href="/contact">Contact</a> page. Simon Willison has an <a title="New anti-comment-spam measure" rel="external" href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2003/10/13/linkRedirects">interesting approach</a> to block comment spam in which he redirects all posted links to eliminate the possibility of affecting <a title="Google" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>&#8216;s PageRank system. This seems to be a logical thing to do if the sole purpose of the spam you are receiving is to increase the Google rank of some site. But what if this isn't the purpose? What if you just get hit with an advertisement for Viagra or such? It still seems like a <acronym title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">captcha</acronym> image is the best solution for blocking automatic submission of spam comments.
