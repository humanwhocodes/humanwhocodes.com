I'm not sure if there's many people left who buy tech books in the old brick-and-mortar stores, but if you're one of those people, swing by your nearest <a title="Borders" rel="external" href="http://www.borders.com">Borders</a> bookstore to pick up your copy of <a title="Professional Ajax, 2nd Edition" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProfessional-Ajax-2nd-Nicholas-Zakas%2Fdp%2F0470109491%2F&tag=nczonline-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Professional Ajax, 2nd Edition</a>. There's a special promotion going on through July 5th. What does that mean exactly? Not sure, but if you don't go out and buy one before July 4th, it means you're unpatriotic. Kidding! Happy advanced Fourth to everyone (::cough:: buy the book ::cough::).
