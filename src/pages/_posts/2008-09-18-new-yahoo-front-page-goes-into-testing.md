I&#8217;ve been at Yahoo! now for over two years, and for almost all of it, I&#8217;ve not been able to talk about what I&#8217;ve been working on. I started out on the [My Yahoo!][1] redesign and then moved onto the front page redesign. Today, the new front page design goes into public testing and I can finally tell everyone that this is what I&#8217;ve been working on since the start of the year. This is the reason for late nights, early mornings, and funless weekends. And you know what? It&#8217;s totally worth it. We have a truly amazing international team of people who have been working tirelessly and around-the-clock (literally) for the past nine months, and I&#8217;m proud to say I was part of that team. To go from nothing on January 1, 2008 to having a viable product on September 18, 2008 is nothing short of amazing.

There&#8217;s tons of press already about the new front page design:

  * [Yahoo&#8217;s All New Home Page a Mix of Old and New][2] (TechCrunch)
  * [Yahoo Tests Home Page Using Outside Content][3] (Wall Street Journal)
  * [Yahoo! Starts to Roll Out New Home Page][4] (Download Squad)

In case you&#8217;re wondering (or haven&#8217;t read the articles above), not everyone will see the new front page yet. We&#8217;re doing random testing trying to figure out what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Random means I have no idea who&#8217;s going to be in the tests and who&#8217;s not, including myself. It&#8217;ll certainly be fun to see the results.
