After nearly five years, today is my last day at Yahoo!. It really seems like only yesterday I was [blogging about my new job][1] and packing up my Peabody, Massachusetts condo to move to California. My plan at the time was to work at Yahoo! for a year to help finish work on My Yahoo! and then evaluate if I wanted to stay in California or move back to Massachusetts. Somewhere along the line, I forgot to make that evaluation and before I knew it, years had passed.

Leaving Yahoo! is incredibly difficult for me. I moved to California without knowing anyone, and so for the past five years, Yahoo! has been my family. Almost everyone I know I met through Yahoo!, including some wonderful and inspirational mentors to whom I will be forever grateful. I was welcomed into the outstanding Yahoo! front-end community and learned so much through hallway conversations and internal talks as well as through my day job. The passion of the front-end engineers at Yahoo! is truly inspirational and is something I will remember for a very long time.

To everyone at Yahoo!: thank you for every single moment of the past five years. I&#8217;ve learned so much from all of you, and your willingness to share and educate is truly your greatest strength. Walking away from you is one of the hardest things I&#8217;ve had to do, and I will continue to cheer for you and hope for your success &#8211; but from now on, I&#8217;ll do so on the sidelines.

I&#8217;m leaving Yahoo! to take a risk. Earlier this year, a few things happened that caused me to do some deep thinking about my life and what I want from it. I realized that I was in a pretty good position: I have some money saved up and no major expenses. I&#8217;m not married, don&#8217;t have kids, and don&#8217;t have a mortgage. I&#8217;m a big believer that you should strive for stability and security in life, and once you find it, take a risk and repeat the process. This seemed like the perfect time to make a big leap. So what&#8217;s next is actually a couple of things.

First, a friend had been talking about a startup idea, and the more I thought about it, the more I liked it. I approached him to ask if he could use my help and off we went. I&#8217;ve been working nights and weekends for several months on this idea and we&#8217;re now getting close to having something real. The things I like about this product include its simplicity, utility to the average person, and the business model. Yes, I&#8217;m speaking in generalities because we&#8217;re not ready to unleash it yet, but hopefully soon.

So I&#8217;ll be spending most of my time over the next few months working on this startup idea and trying to make it real. I&#8217;m proud to say that the team for this product is made up of several former Yahoos, which is another reason that it is so appealing. We&#8217;ve got a really great group of people working on this product, though there is room for at least one more: I&#8217;m looking for a really great back-end engineer, preferably with search experience, to join the team. If you&#8217;re interested and live in the San Francisco Bay Area, please [contact me][2].

The second thing I&#8217;ll be doing is teaming up with my friend (and former Yahoo) Nicole Sullivan to do consulting work. Nicole and I have talked off and on about working together on outside projects after having fun working together on a couple of projects at Yahoo!. Between the two of us, we hope to provide a wide range of front-end consulting services including performance evaluations, general architecture, and of course, JavaScript and CSS. If you&#8217;re interested in hiring us, please email projects (at) stubbornella.org.

With all of the changes, there are also some things that won&#8217;t change. I&#8217;ll still be living in California (for the time being). I&#8217;ll still be a contributor to YUI and will be pushing YUI Test towards version 1.0. I&#8217;ll still be writing books and blog posts. I&#8217;ll still be speaking at conferences. And most importantly, I&#8217;ll still be working with some of the great friends I&#8217;ve made while at Yahoo!.

Hopefully five years from now I&#8217;ll look back and see this as another good decision in my life. And if not, at least it will be an interesting experience.
