After tons of unofficial hacks, Google has finally embraced the interest in <a title="Google Maps" rel="external" href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> and released a public <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>! The <a title="The World is your JavaScript Enabled Oyster" rel="external" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/06/world-is-your-javascript-enabled_29.html">announcement</a> came yesterday, along with the immediate availability of the <a title="Google Maps API" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym></a>.

Quite frankly, I can&#8217;t wait to dig into Google Maps and come up with some cool ways of using it. You must register for a subscriber ID, similar to other Google services, but after that, it&#8217;s a free-for-all of functionality. I know Google is on their way to becoming the next Microsoft, but on the way they&#8217;re really making the Web an exciting place to live, learn, and develop through the publishing of their <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>s. Go Google!
