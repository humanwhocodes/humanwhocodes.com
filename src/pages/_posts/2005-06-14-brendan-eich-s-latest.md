Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, has an <a title="JavaScript 1, 2, and in between" rel="external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050830010412/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/008325.html">interesting post</a> over at his blog regarding JavaScript's future direction. Of course, JavaScript has suffered from severe stagnation as of the past few years and until <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> popped up, some had already considered it dead.

Brendan points out, correctly I may add, that JavaScript has never gone away and it certainly isn't going away anytime soon. Though there are some quirks, we've all learned to live with them and changing them now would be difficult. While the long-awaited ECMAScript 4 is still under development, other JavaScript-compatible technologies have been standardized, such as <a title="ECMAScript for XML" rel="external" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-357.htm">ECMAScript for XML</a>.

I also agree with Brendan's assertion that JavaScript needn't become Java or any other higher-level programming language. It is what it is, and that's all it is. Really, it's just as easy to add new methods to existing object and new objects to create new functionality; why bother redefining the language?

In any event, it's a good read, you should check it out.
