Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, has an <a title="JavaScript 1, 2, and in between" rel="external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050830010412/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/008325.html">interesting post</a> over at his blog regarding JavaScript&#8217;s future direction. Of course, JavaScript has suffered from severe stagnation as of the past few years and until <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> popped up, some had already considered it dead.

Brendan points out, correctly I may add, that JavaScript has never gone away and it certainly isn&#8217;t going away anytime soon. Though there are some quirks, we&#8217;ve all learned to live with them and changing them now would be difficult. While the long-awaited ECMAScript 4 is still under development, other JavaScript-compatible technologies have been standardized, such as <a title="ECMAScript for XML" rel="external" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-357.htm">ECMAScript for XML</a>.

I also agree with Brendan&#8217;s assertion that JavaScript needn&#8217;t become Java or any other higher-level programming language. It is what it is, and that&#8217;s all it is. Really, it&#8217;s just as easy to add new methods to existing object and new objects to create new functionality; why bother redefining the language?

In any event, it&#8217;s a good read, you should check it out.
