Part of the fun of writing a book is getting to interact with readers about it. To this end, the good folks over at <a title="Wrox Press" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox</a> have set up a <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers Forum" rel="external" href="http://p2p.wrox.com/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=171">Professional JavaScript Forum</a> to facilitate discussion surrounding the book. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions while reading the book, please post them at the forum. This way, others can also benefit from your questions.
