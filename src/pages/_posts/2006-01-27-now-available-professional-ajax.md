The moment of truth is upon us: you can now order <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471777781/">Professional Ajax</a> from Amazon! I&#8217;m hoping that everyone finds this a nice follow-up to <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764579088/">Professional JavaScript</a> (which is now in a second printing, by the way). The guys and I worked really hard trying to make this the best possible <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> book we could come up with, and I hope that all the readers agree. As usual, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact me with any issues.

By the way, if you were one of the reviewers for Professional JavaScript, don&#8217;t go out and buy your copy yet. Check your mail first&#8230;
