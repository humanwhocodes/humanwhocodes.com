Just a quick note to remind everyone that the <a title="Rich Web Experience" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com">Rich Web Experience 2007</a> is just a couple of weeks away (September 6-8) and I&#8217;ll be making two presentations. The first is on Maintainable JavaScript, the one I gave at the internal Yahoo! developer conference earlier this year. This will be the first time I&#8217;ll be giving this to an external audience. The second one is on Enterprise JavaScript Error Handling, discussing how to anticipate and handle errors when they appear in JavaScript.

I&#8217;m really excited about speaking and I hope you&#8217;ll be there to share this experience with me. To help, I&#8217;ll give you $200 off the price of admission. All you need to do is enter the code nfjs2007speaker200 when you register. And did I mention that attendees get a choice of either a Wii or an iPod Video?

If you&#8217;ll be attending, please come find me and introduce yourself. I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting a lot of people and I hope one of them is you. See you there.

**P.S.** If you&#8217;re responsible for organizing a conference or developer speaker series, I&#8217;d love to come speak for you too. Just drop me a line.
