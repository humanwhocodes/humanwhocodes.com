I was just talking to my mom, who had just talked to my aunt, who apparently went into <a title="Borders" rel="external" href="https://www.borders.com">Borders</a> and asked someone to look up my book. Apparently, she saw the cover of the book, which led to me wonder if it would be up online. Sure enough, it's available for <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764579088/qid=1105481108/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-9733195-7492141?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">pre-order at Amazon.com</a> now!

The ironic thing is that the book isn't even posted on <a title="Wrox Books" rel="external" href="https://www.wrox.com">Wrox's Web site</a> yet.
