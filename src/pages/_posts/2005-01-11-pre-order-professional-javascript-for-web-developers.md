I was just talking to my mom, who had just talked to my aunt, who apparently went into <a title="Borders" rel="external" href="http://www.borders.com">Borders</a> and asked someone to look up my book. Apparently, she saw the cover of the book, which led to me wonder if it would be up online. Sure enough, it&#8217;s available for <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764579088/qid=1105481108/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-9733195-7492141?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">pre-order at Amazon.com</a> now!

The ironic thing is that the book isn&#8217;t even posted on <a title="Wrox Books" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox&#8217;s Web site</a> yet.
