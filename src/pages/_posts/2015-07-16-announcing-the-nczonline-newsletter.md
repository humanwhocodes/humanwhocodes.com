For a while, I&#8217;ve been toying with the idea of writing more short form content. While I love the long form of writing, it does take a lot of energy and as such I&#8217;ve been unable to do the regular amount of writing that I normally do. I thought about doing short form content on the blog, but it just seemed to be a bit out of place. Meanwhile, I had started doing a weekly email at work with useful and important links I&#8217;d read recently and got some really good feedback from that. Over the course of the past several weeks, the idea of having a public newsletter that combined short form writing and recommended links grew on me, both as a way to encourage me to keep writing and as a way to share what I&#8217;ve been reading and why I think it&#8217;s important.

And so, the NCZOnline Newsletter will be starting in August and be sent every two weeks on Tuesday, with the first edition coming out August 4. Here&#8217;s what you can expect in each edition:

  1. A short form essay on the same topics you see on my blog: JavaScript, web development, software engineering, technical leadership, architecture, teamwork, and generally any topic that will help you become a better software engineer. This content will be unique and not part of my blog.
  2. Links to three things (videos, articles, podcasts) that I think everyone needs to see. These won&#8217;t all necessarily be recent, but they will all be guaranteed to be worth your time. (If you want a list of recent happenings in the JavaScript world, then [JavaScript Weekly][1] is what you&#8217;re looking for.)
  3. A recommended book. Once again, this won&#8217;t necessarily be only technical books, but rather, books that can make you a better, more well-rounded software engineer and person.
  4. Discounts! I periodically receive discount codes for various things (books, conferences, etc.), and I&#8217;ll be sharing those with you as I receive them.

You can sign up by using the form at the bottom of this page (if you&#8217;re reading this on my blog) or by using the [standalone signup form][2] (if you&#8217;re reading this via RSS or email). Your email address will *never* be sold or shared, and you can unsubscribe at any point in time with a link in each newsletter. If you had previously signed up for updates by mail, then you will receive the newsletter as well. It&#8217;s still possible to receive just blog post updates and not the email newsletter (or vice versa) by updating your preferences on the signup form.

I&#8217;m currently looking for sponsors for the newsletter. While I&#8217;m happy to provide the newsletter for free, the software and services I use do cost money, and I&#8217;m looking for a way to offset those costs. If you&#8217;re interested in sponsoring the newsletter (even for just one edition), please [contact me][3].

My goal with this newsletter is to make it feel like I&#8217;m mentoring each subscriber (sharing stories and links are both what I do with those I&#8217;m mentoring in real life). As such, you&#8217;ll be able to reply to each newsletter to send a message to me, and I guarantee I will read every single email. I expect the newsletter to evolve based on subscriber feedback so that it&#8217;s really a conversation rather than a monologue. I hope you&#8217;ll join me.
