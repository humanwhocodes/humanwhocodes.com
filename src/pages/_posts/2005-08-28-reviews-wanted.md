Well, it's that time in the writing process again; the time where I ask all of you for input on what has been written so far. I'm looking for ten people *with JavaScript expertise* to review the unpublished, rough draft of the upcoming *Professional Ajax* book. You'll be asked to provide feedback on the material, how it is presented, the overall readability, and of course, any other helpful comments will be gladly accepted. For complete information, please check out the <a title="Reviewer Application" rel="internal" href="/writing/reviewers/">Reviewer Application</a>.
