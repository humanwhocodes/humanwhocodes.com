Everytime I see something cool with JavaScript, it goes on my personal &#8220;things to investigate for Pro JS second edition&#8221; list. I tried to make the first edition cover everything I could think of, but clearly I couldn&#8217;t think of everything. My question to everyone out there is this: what do you want to see in the second edition of Professional JavaScript?

To facilitate this discussion, I&#8217;ve set up a topic in the <a title="Profesional JavaScript for Web Developers Forum" rel="external" href="http://p2p.wrox.com/forum.asp?FORUM_ID=171">Professional JavaScript forum</a>. Please <a title="What do you want to see for 2nd edition??? " rel="external" href="http://p2p.wrox.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=41419">stop by</a> and let me know what you&#8217;d like to see in the next edition of the book. Oh, and don&#8217;t put &#8220;more Ajax stuff&#8221;&#8230;that&#8217;s what <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0471777781%2F">Professional Ajax</a> is for. <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
