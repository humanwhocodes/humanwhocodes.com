A lot has been written about XMLHttp since the term <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> was popularized, but it's not just about XMLHttp. <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> is about getting data from the server without unloading the current page, plain and simple, and there are other ways to accomplish this without using XMLHttp. To that end, I've begun a series of articles over at <a title="WebReference" rel="external" href="http://www.webreference.com">WebReference</a> exploring alternate Ajax techniques. The first explores <a title="Alternate Ajax Techniques, Part 1" rel="external" href="http://webreference.com/r/pg/ajax_tech/">dynamic script loading</a>. I hope you enjoy!
