I've <a title="I love my job" rel="internal" href="https://humanwhocodes.com/archive/2006/10/384">said before</a> that I really like working at <a title="Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>, so with that bias stated, I want to tell everyone about a little-known Yahoo! property called <a title="FareChase" rel="external" href="http://farechase.yahoo.com">FareChase</a>.

You know all those sites that offer airline tickets at discounted prices? You know how each only searches a small set of airlines, so you need to go to multiple sites to see if you got the best deal? Well, FareChase does the site-hopping for you. Just type in your flight details and it searches all of the top flight web sites like <a title="Orbitz" rel="external" href="http://www.orbitz.com">Orbitz</a> and <a title="CheapTickets" rel="external" href="http://www.cheaptickets.com">CheapTickets</a>, as well as the web sites of airlines that allow online travel booking.

I've now used this service twice and I'm still amazed that it doesn't get more press. It's an absolutely incredible service that makes finding flights so much easier. And I'm not just saying that because I work at Yahoo!(honestly!).
