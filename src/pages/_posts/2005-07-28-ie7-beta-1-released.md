It looks like Microsoft has released the first beta of <a title="Internet Explorer 7" rel="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/ie7/default.mspx">Internet Explorer 7</a>&#8230;but only to <acronym title="Microsoft Developer's Network">MSDN</acronym> subscribers. Oh, and it only runs on Windows XP Service Pack 2. As usual, seems like <a title="IE7 Beta, XP" rel="external" href="http://www.forgetfoo.com/?blogid=4234">some people</a> have found a way around the <acronym title="Microsoft Developer's Network">MSDN</acronym> subscription issue.

Here&#8217;s some general comments I&#8217;ve seen throughout the blogosphere:

  * **Tabs** &#8211; the tabs work fairly well and are pretty fast. There is a blank tab to the right that you can click to add a new tab.
  * **<acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym> support** &#8211; <acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym> transparency works natively, but may not work properly if you&#8217;re applying a <acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym> transparency fix for older browser versions.
  * **Syndication** &#8211; there&#8217;s a built-in <a title="Screenshot of IE7 Syndication Reader" rel="external" href="http://www.blackdot.be/images/upload/ie7_rss.jpg">syndication reader</a> that can read <acronym title="Channel Definition Format">CDF</acronym> and <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym>. In general, the browser autodetects the presence of site syndication and displays an icon in the toolbar that brings you to the feed.
  * **User Interface** &#8211; Microsoft took an interesting approach to the IE 7 interface. The very top bar has back and forward buttons, the address bar, a button that toggles between refresh, stop, and go, and a search area. Inside each tab is a menu and the home, favorites, history, and print buttons. The <a title="Screenshot of IE 7 window" rel="external" href="http://www.blackdot.be/images/upload/ie7_overview.jpg">window itself</a> looks fairly clean, but I bet the button locations take a little getting used to. There are also reports that this isn&#8217;t the standard browser setup and it can be changed.
  * **<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>** &#8211; the overwhelming opinion is that there aren&#8217;t enough improvements as of yet. Stuff still breaks, developers aren&#8217;t happy.

The <a title="Windows Vista & IE7 Beta 1 Available" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/27/444004.aspx">announcement</a> heard round the world describes the process, and as usual, there are a bunch of <a title="Windows Vista & IE7 Beta 1 Available - Comment" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/07/27/444004.aspx#444246">unhappy commenters</a> about the whole experience. As best I can tell, no one has really mentioned any JavaScript changes so far.
