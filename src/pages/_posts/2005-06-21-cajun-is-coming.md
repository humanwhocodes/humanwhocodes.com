When I first wrote about <acronym title="Canvas Assisted JavaScript UnderNeath">Cajun</acronym> [last month][1], a bunch of us <a title="JavaScript's Future: Cajun - Comments" rel="internal" href="{{site.url}}/archive/2005/5/199#comments">were wondering</a> how the `canvas` element could be mimicked in Internet Explorer. Turns out someone beat us to the punch.

<a title="Novell XForms Explorer" rel="external" href="http://lab.cph.novell.com/nxie/home.html">Novell XForms Explorer</a> is a plugin for Internet Explorer to allow pages to render, and use, XForms properly. Apparently, the latest version also supports a basic version of the `canvas` element. An <a title="Canvas Clock" rel="external" href="http://lab.cph.novell.com/nxie/clock.html">example</a> is posted on the site that shows off the power of <acronym title="Canvas Assisted JavaScript UnderNeath">Cajun</acronym> (you must have XForms Explorer installed to see it).
