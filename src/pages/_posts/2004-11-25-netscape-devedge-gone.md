Apparently, Netscape&#8217;s DevEdge site (previously at http://devedge.netscape.com) has been taken down. This was one of the great Web developer resources, containing all kinds of great code examples, explanations, and other interesting Web-related content.

While researching for my book, I used DevEdge a lot in the early months, but hadn&#8217;t tried to access it again until today. Come to find out it&#8217;s been gone for nearly a month. What a sad, sad turn of events, especially given that the content isn&#8217;t available anywhere else and <a href="http://www.google.com" title="Google" rel="external">Google</a> doesn&#8217;t seem to have it cached.
