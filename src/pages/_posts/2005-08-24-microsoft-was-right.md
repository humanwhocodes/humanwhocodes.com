Yeah, you read that correctly, Microsoft was right. About what? About Google. Long before Google released <a title="Google Desktop" rel="external" href="http://desktop.google.com">Google Desktop</a> or the just-today-released <a title="Google Talk" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google Talk</a>, Microsoft was worried. They saw Google as a threat to their operating system monopoly. And they were right.

You can say what you want about Microsoft&#8217;s ability to create good software, but they can sniff out competition long before the rest of us do. Notice that it&#8217;s now called Google Desktop, not Google Desktop Search? Notice the addition of the sidebar, which Microsoft had planned for something similar in Windows Vista? Notice that Google Talk doesn&#8217;t communicate with any other instant message services? Google is trying to control your entire computer and communications, your e-mail, your instant messaging, and possibly next your Web browsing. There have long been rumors of a Google browser being built upon Firefox, could that be around the corner?
