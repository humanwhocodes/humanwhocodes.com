Just when you thought it was safe to use Internet Explorer, the IE 7 Beta 2 Preview has just been released and can be <a title="Internet Explorer 7 Beta 2 Preview" rel="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/IE/ie7/ie7betaredirect.mspx">downloaded</a>. As with all other versions of IE, this one will eat up your current IE 6, never to be seen again until you uninstall IE 7 Beta. So it's probably best if you don't download this on your main development machine, as there are to be some major changes in the layout of pages.

New in this release are some user interface changes, as well as built-in <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> reader similar to what Safari offers. I'm interested to see if this version has the native XMLHttp object.
