It's almost here. <a title="The Rich Web Experience" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com">The Rich Web Experience</a> is just about a week away and I'm getting pretty excited. I've just finished uploading my slides for my two presentations and I really can't wait to get started. It's my first external conference so I'm looking forward to&#8230;well&#8230;pretty much everything about it.

To make things a bit more interesting, I've decided to make a scavenger hunt for myself. I have a short list of people with whom I'd like to get a photograph. I'm not real big on autographs, but I love having photos of myself with recognizable people. So here's the people I'm hoping to coax into taking a photo with me at the conference:

  * <a title="Douglas Crockford" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/douglas_crockford.html">Douglas Crockford</a> &#8211; Yes, he works at Yahoo! too and yes, I see him from time to time, and yes, I have actually spoken to him on occassion, but I don't walk around campus with a camera.
  * <a title="Jesse James Garrett" rel="external" href="http://http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/jesse_james_garrett.html">Jesse James Garrett</a> &#8211; pure geek cred. Nuff said.
  * <a title="Alex Russell" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/alex_russell.html">Alex Russell</a> &#8211; I've never met Alex, seems like a good icebreaker.
  * <a title="Joe Walker" rel="external" href="http://http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/joe_walker.html">Joe Walker</a> &#8211; Loved DWR from the start and really helped with the first edition of <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProfessional-Ajax-2nd-Nicholas-Zakas%2Fdp%2F0470109491%2F&tag=nczonline-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Professional Ajax</a> on the DWR section.
  * <a title="Molly Holzschlag" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/molly_holzschlag.html">Molly Holzschlag</a> &#8211; I just find the stuff she writes interesting.
  * <a title="Nicholas Eddy" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/nick_eddy.html">Nicholas Eddy</a> &#8211; the only other Nicholas speaking at the conference. Props for using your full first name!
  * <a title="Sean Kane" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com/conference/speaker/sean_kane.html">Sean Kane</a> &#8211; I don't use Netflix, but I think its interface is pretty slick.

So that's it. Hopefully I'm on someone's scavenger hunt list, too. <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
