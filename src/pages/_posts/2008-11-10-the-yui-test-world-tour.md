When I wrote [YUI Test][1], my hope was to generate interest in unit testing for JavaScript. I became a fan of unit testing several years ago and have constantly been seeking ways to inject more of it into my development. I had hoped to publicize the framework this year and really get the word out. I didn&#8217;t get the opportunity in the first half of 2008 due to a frantic work schedule, but starting in the fall, I embarked on what I&#8217;ve lovingly called the YUI Test world tour. The schedule, dating back to the first talk, looks like this:

  * **The Rich Web Experience West** (September) &#8211; sadly, this event was canceled so the debut had to be postponed.
  * **The Ajax Experience** (September-October) &#8211; the first public presentation of my talk, Test Driven Development with YUI Test ([slides][2]).
  * **Yahoo! Front End Summit** (October) &#8211; our annual, in-house front end development conference, where I presented a more Yahoo!-focused version of my talk ([video][3]).
  * **LinkedIn** (November) &#8211; coming up this week, I&#8217;ll be heading up the highway to talk about YUI Test with the good folks at LinkedIn.
  * **NASA Research** (December) &#8211; originally postponed from this month, I&#8217;m going to share the test driven development love with the web gurus at NASA.

I&#8217;m hoping to keep this whirlwind tour going and continue to spread the word of test driven development. If you&#8217;d like me to stop by your workplace, conference, or school, [drop me a line][4] and I&#8217;ll see what I can do.
