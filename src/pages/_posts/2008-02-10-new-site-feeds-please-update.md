Just a quick note to let everyone know I'm going to be moving the location of the feeds for my site. This is part of my ongoing quest to finally update the design/layout/architecture of this site. I'll keep the old links working for a bit, but for better forwards-compatibility, please update your favorite newsreader to point to the following link:

<a rel="internal" href="http://feeds.nczonline.net/blog/">http://feeds.nczonline.net/blog/</a>

Also, I haven't really been keeping my JavaScript links up to date. Now I'll be leveraging <a title="del.icio.us" rel="external" href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> for managing those and the new feed link for that is here:

<a rel="internal" href="http://feeds.nczonline.net/links/javascript/">http://feeds.nczonline.net/links/javascript/</a>

I'll be working on adding other useful feeds in the coming weeks. My goal is to make every part of the site into a feed that can be subscribed to separately.

Again, please update your news readers as soon as you can. I'm not sure how long I'll keep around the old links, so don't get left out of the party!
