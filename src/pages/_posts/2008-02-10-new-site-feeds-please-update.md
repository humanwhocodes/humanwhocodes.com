Just a quick note to let everyone know I&#8217;m going to be moving the location of the feeds for my site. This is part of my ongoing quest to finally update the design/layout/architecture of this site. I&#8217;ll keep the old links working for a bit, but for better forwards-compatibility, please update your favorite newsreader to point to the following link:

<a rel="internal" href="http://feeds.nczonline.net/blog/">http://feeds.nczonline.net/blog/</a>

Also, I haven&#8217;t really been keeping my JavaScript links up to date. Now I&#8217;ll be leveraging <a title="del.icio.us" rel="external" href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> for managing those and the new feed link for that is here:

<a rel="internal" href="http://feeds.nczonline.net/links/javascript/">http://feeds.nczonline.net/links/javascript/</a>

I&#8217;ll be working on adding other useful feeds in the coming weeks. My goal is to make every part of the site into a feed that can be subscribed to separately.

Again, please update your news readers as soon as you can. I&#8217;m not sure how long I&#8217;ll keep around the old links, so don&#8217;t get left out of the party!
