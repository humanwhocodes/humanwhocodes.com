It has always baffled me why people don&#8217;t treat JavaScript like any other programming language. You wouldn&#8217;t start trying to develop an application in C without understanding the basics first, would you? Yet, this is what developers do constantly when dealing with JavaScript. They don&#8217;t want to learn JavaScript, they want to get right into the mix.

Part of the reason I wrote <a title="Professional JavaScript" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0764579088%2F">Professional JavaScript</a> in the manner I did is because I wanted people to treat it like a programming language instead of a toy that web designers use to make &#8220;cool&#8221; effects. Now, this did garner some negative reviews from non-programmers, but that was to be expected. While <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> is the current buzzword, it&#8217;s also encouraging a whole new slew of people who don&#8217;t know JavaScript to try and make it do things that require a good working knowledge of the language. How do I know? <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0471777781%2F">Professional Ajax</a> is selling much better than the first book, but it requires no less technical knowledge. I have seen many more posts in forums by people wanting to implement <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> solutions that begin with, &#8220;please help me, I don&#8217;t really know JavaScript.&#8221; ::sigh::

Though the reviews are only beginning to come in, I&#8217;m sure the <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> book will get some similar reviews. This is where I accent the *Professional* part of the titles; both of these books are intended for programming professionals, not beginners. This is what we need more of: programmers who really understand JavaScript.
