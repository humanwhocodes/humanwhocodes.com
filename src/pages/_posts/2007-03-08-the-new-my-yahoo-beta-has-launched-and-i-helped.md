For the past nine months, people have been asking me what I've been doing at <a title="Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> since I joined. They've asked me to talk about it, to blog about it, to let everyone know what was the draw that got me to go to <a title="I'm a Yahoo!" rel="internal" href="https://humanwhocodes.com/archive/2006/6/349">Yahoo! over Google</a> so long ago. It was the opportunity to help redefine one of the most important web sites on the Internet: <a title="My Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://my.yahoo.com">My Yahoo!</a>.

Today, I'm proud to <a title="My Yahoo! Gets Web 2.0 Makeover" rel="external" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/my_yahoo_web20_makeover.php">announce</a> that we've launched a brand new version of My Yahoo! in the United States as a limited beta. This is what I, and a number of incredibly smart engineers, have been working on all this time. We've been quietly keeping our mouths shut as <a title="NetVibes" rel="external" href="http://www.netvibes.com">NetVibes</a> and <a title="PageFlakes" rel="external" href="http://www.pageflakes.com">PageFlakes</a> have made announcements and people have said that My Yahoo! wasn't keeping up. We kept quiet so as not to ruin the surprise.

I was so happy that we had no leaks, and that this came as a huge surprise to everyone. This product is the result of the tireless efforts of a bunch of people who truly have passion for this product and believe in its future. I'm just happy to be able to say that I was involved with this group of people and that I was able to lend a hand in developing the vision that first convinced me that Yahoo! was the place I wanted to be.

When can you see it? If you've been a My Yahoo! user, you may notice a little something that shows you how to see the new version. If you're not a user&#8230;well shame on you. What have you been doing all this time? <img src="https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />
