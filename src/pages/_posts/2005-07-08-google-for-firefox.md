Seems like Google has finally caught up with other extension builders for <a title="Mozilla Firefox" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">Firefox</a> and has released beta versions of the <a title="Google Firefox Extensions" rel="external" href="http://toolbar.google.com/firefox/extensions/">Google Toolbar and two experimental extensions</a>. The Google Toolbar is just as it is for Internet Explorer, though minus the popup blocker since it's built into Firefox. The other two extensions are interesting.

The <a title="Google Send to Phone for Firefox" rel="external" href="http://toolbar.google.com/firefox/extensions/sendtophone/index.html">first</a> is a way to send text messages directly from the browser. Using this extension, you can type in the number of a cell phone user, select the carrier, and send a brief message. Not sure how useful this is, especially given that <acronym title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</acronym> already has this functionality. But hey, kudos to Google for doing something cool.

The <a title="Google Suggest for Firefox" rel="external" href="http://toolbar.google.com/firefox/extensions/suggest/index.html">second extension</a> brings <a title="Google Suggest" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en">Google Suggest</a> to the Firefox search box. While typing in a search term for Google, you are presented with a list of possible terms.
