Seems like everyone and their uncle has some sort of <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> library these days. And if you're uncle is <a title="Adobe" rel="external" href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>, then you definitely need to be paying closer attention. Without too much fanfare, Adobe released a couple of libraries to aid in the mixing of Flex with <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym>. You can download the library from <a title="Adobe Labs" rel="external" href="http://labs.macromedia.com/">Adobe Labs</a>.

The <a title="Flex Ajax Bridge" rel="external" href="http://labs.macromedia.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_Framework:FABridge">Flex <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> Bridge</a> is designed to allow easy interaction between Flex components and the JavaScript running on the client. These libraries can be embedded into Flex controls which can then expose most or all of their functionality through JavaScript.

You can read more about this over at Information Week: <a title="Adobe Bridges Flash, Flex with AJAX" rel="external" href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1935479,00.asp">Adobe Bridges Flash, Flex with AJAX</a>. (hat tip: Lonnie)
