One of the more interesting features of <a title="Netscape 8" rel="external" href="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/">Netscape 8</a> was it's ability to embed Internet Explorer in it, so that trusted sites could use <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>&#8216;s rendering engine. I tried Netscape 8 the other day at work and noticed some issues when I went back and tried to use <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> again, namely with <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> files. Finally, there's an answer.

Over on <a title="IEBlog" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IEBlog</a>, they <a title="Netscape 8 and Internet Explorer's XML Rendering" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/05/25/421763.aspx">confirm the problem</a> and provide a workaround. How is it that Netscape didn't test this out ahead of time? Yeah, way to go in your attempts to re-gain market share.
