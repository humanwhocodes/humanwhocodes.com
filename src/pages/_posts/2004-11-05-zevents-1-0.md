It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve written any JavaScript libraries what with the book and all. But here it is, the first of several new JavaScript libraries: zEvents 1.0.

zEvents is a JavaScript library of classes that can enable events and event handling in your own custom classes. Download version 1.0 in the <a href="{{site.url}}/downloads" rel="internal" title="Downloads">Downloads</a> section.
