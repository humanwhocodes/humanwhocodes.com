Today I received the first copy of my book. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not actually mine; it&#8217;s a copy for a reviewer that I&#8217;ll be signing and sending out. Is it weird that the reviewers get a copy of the book before me? Ah well, it&#8217;s still pretty cool, if not creepy, to see my face on top of a book. I wonder if I&#8217;ll be able to go to a bookstore and find it.

In any event, the official release isn&#8217;t for a couple more days, so <a title="Pre-order my book" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764579088/qid=1105481108/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-9733195-7492141?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Amazon</a> still says you need to pre-order it. However, if you do, you should receive it fairly quickly since they&#8217;re all printed up and ready to go.
