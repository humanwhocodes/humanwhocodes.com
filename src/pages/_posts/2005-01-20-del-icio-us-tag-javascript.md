A while back I decided to check out del.icio.us for JavaScript-related content. I found a couple of categories, most notably <a title="del.icio.us/tag/javascript" rel="external" href="http://del.icio.us/tag/javascript">del.icio.us/tag/javascript</a>, which is constantly updated with new articles relating to JavaScript.

The problem is that it's *constantly* updated, with over 20 new entries per day. What's worse is that articles are duplicated in the list over and over and over again, so my <a title="Mozilla Thunderbird" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> gets filled up with hundreds of articles by the end of the week, many of them duplicates. I wish someone would keep tabs on that stuff and only present the uniques. I've been considering adding a bunch of regularly updated technology links here, maybe I really should just buckle down and do it.
