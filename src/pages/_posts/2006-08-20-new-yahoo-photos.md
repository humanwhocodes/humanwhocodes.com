I decided to upgrade my <a title="Yahoo! Photos" rel="external" href="http://photos.yahoo.com">Yahoo! Photos</a> to the beta version (which apparently won&#8217;t be in beta for too much longer), and I must say, the interface is really slick. Tons of drag-and-drop solutions (though I find double clicking to view a photo a little disconcerting). I was really excited to try the new photo upload tool when&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t work. Actually, it looks like no uploads are working. I tried the old file input form, tried it in Firefox and IE, and nothing seems to be working. This has been going on the past few days. Has anyone else experienced this?

It&#8217;s too bad, because I was really excited to get going with the new photos app. But if I can&#8217;t share my photos by uploading them, there&#8217;s really no point.
