The latest comment left on Amazon regarding <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764579088/qid=1105481108/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-4468170-7639132?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Professional JavaScript</a> points out a problem that I was unaware of: some of the downloadable examples don&#8217;t work. In Brett Merkey&#8217;s words:

> I can understand errors creeping into print, but errors in example files can be corrected at any time by the author and publishers. That they have not bothered is regrettable.

He&#8217;s absolutely right, and quite frankly, I&#8217;m really annoyed that any of the examples don&#8217;t work. I hate getting books where the code doesn&#8217;t work and I tried my best to make sure that this didn&#8217;t turn into one of those books. Unfortunately, no one had alerted me that the examples weren&#8217;t working to this point.

To Brett, and other readers, I&#8217;m going to sit down this weekend and go through each and every example from the download site. I&#8217;ve already spoken with <a title="Wrox Editor Blog" rel="external" href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com">my editor</a> and once I&#8217;ve made the corrections, they will be posted for download on the [Wrox][1] site.

As always, I appreciate people like Brett who give a fair and honest review of my book and code. It&#8217;s only through this type of feedback that I&#8217;ll be able to become a better writer and create better books in the future.
