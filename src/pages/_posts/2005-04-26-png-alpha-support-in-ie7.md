There&#8217;s a <a title="IE7 Transparent PNG Implementation" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/04/26/412263.aspx">posting</a> over at <a title="IEBlog" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">IEBlog</a> explaining (roughly) how <acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym> alpha support was added to <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>7. This particular blog entry was written by Sam Fortiner, the one who implemented the functionality. So it&#8217;s official now, <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>7 will have <acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym> alpha support!
