Although Microsoft is keeping quiet on what features version 7 of Internet Explorer will have when questioned by the public, it appears that <a title="Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 Details Begin to Leak" rel="external" href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1776290,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">key partners</a> have been clued in on several features of the next generation browser.

First, the partners say, there will be native tabbed browsing support. Not shocking, I say, since it&#8217;s one of the easiest features to implement (although with Microsoft&#8217;s track record, we may be in store for <a title="Multiple Browsers Tabbed Browsing Vulnerabilities" rel="external" href="http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2004-10/advisory/">cross-tab security issues</a> galore). More from the <a title="Microsoft Watch" rel="external" href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com">Microsoft Watch</a> article:

> IE 7.0 will feature international domain name (IDN) support; transparent Portable Network Graphics (PNG) support, which will allow for the display of overlayed images in the browser; and new functionality that will simplify printing from inside IE 7.0, partner sources said. The new browser also will likely include a built-in news aggregator.

The article also says that Microsoft is unsure of the level of <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>2 support in the new browser. They may implement some features but not the entire standard. Big thumbs down on that one.
