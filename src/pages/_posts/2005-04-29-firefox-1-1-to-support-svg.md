Another of the stories I apparently missed was <a title="Mozilla Firefox 1.1 to Support SVG" rel="external" href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6393">the announcement</a> that <a title="Mozilla Firefox" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox">Firefox</a> 1.1 will support <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> by default. This is great news! I'm a huge believer in <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> and the possibility of serving up `application/xhtml+svg+xml` pages is very exciting (to me, at least). In my humble opinion, it's this type of mixed content that is the future of the Web.
