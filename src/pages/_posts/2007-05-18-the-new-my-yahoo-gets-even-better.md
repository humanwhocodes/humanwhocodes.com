Over the past couple months, my team and I have been slaving away, night and day (literally), making the new <a title="My Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://my.yahoo.com">My Yahoo!</a> even better. Yesterday, we pushed out another major upgrade featuring improved performance, a bunch of new modules, and an all-new inline personalization experience. The last one is perhaps the most exciting, meaning that you don't need to leave the page in order to add new content.

We've gotten some good press with this latest release:

  * <a title="New stuff at My Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/16/new-stuff-at-my-yahoo/">New stuff at My Yahoo!</a> (Techcrunch)
  * <a title="Yahoo update today" rel="external" href="http://rexduffdixon.com/?p=2709">Yahoo update today</a> (Technically Speaking)
  * <a title="My Yahoo gets inline editing, Netflix module" rel="external" href="http://mashable.com/2007/05/16/myyahoo/">My Yahoo gets inline editing, Netflix module</a> (Mashable)
  * <a title="My Yahoo now almost as good as NetVibes" rel="external" href="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9720300-2.html?tag=blog">My Yahoo now almost as good as Netvibes</a> (Webware)

It's really an exciting time to be a <a title="My Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://my.yahoo.com">My Yahoo!</a> user, and only more good things are to come (and no, I still can't tell you what those things are, so please don't ask <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /> ).
