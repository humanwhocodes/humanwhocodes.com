Perhaps I've just been living in a cave for the past couple years, but I had no idea that PayPal had a <a title="PayPal Developers Kit" rel="external" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/pdn/software_dev_kit_php-outside">software development kit</a> for including online payments on your own site. There's even a <a title="PayPal Sandbox" rel="external" href="https://developer.paypal.com/">sandbox site</a> that developers can use to build and test their PayPal solutions securely but with fake data (no more sending yourself one cent over and over again to test). How cool is that?
