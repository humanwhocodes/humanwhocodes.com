I was doing a search tonight to see if anyone had reviewed my book yet when I came across the blog of <a title="Jim Minatel's Wrox Book Editor Blog" rel="external" href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/">Jim Minatel</a>, who is my acquisitions editor over at <a title="Wiley Publishing" rel="external" href="http://www.wiley.com">Wiley</a> (which owns <a title="Wrox Press" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox</a>). In any event, I came across two postings over there that I was sort of humbled by: <a title="Nicholas Zakas, my other new author success" rel="external" href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/2005/04/nicholas_zakas_.html">Nicholas Zakas, my other new author success</a> and <a title="AJAX discussions prove interest in Javascript" rel="external" href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/2005/04/ajax_discussion.html">AJAX discussions prove interest in Javascript</a>.

Certainly, I put my heart and soul into my book. It&#8217;s my baby and it represents nearly two years of my life, so it&#8217;s so nice and rewarding to hear kind words about it. Whether it be from my own editor, a reader, or my mom (she&#8217;s a big fan, though she doesn&#8217;t understand any of what I write about), it&#8217;s always nice to know that your hard work is appreciated. Hug an author today!
