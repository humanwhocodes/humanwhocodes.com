The <a title="IEBlog - Hello from LA!" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/13/465338.aspx">IEBlog latest post</a> spells out some interesting additions being made to Internet Explorer 7 that developers will be happy about:

  * **Native XMLHttp** &#8211; IE7 will have a native XMLHttp object, meaning that you don&#8217;t need to create an ActiveX object at all. This is especially useful when the user&#8217;s security settings forbid creation of ActiveX objects.
  * **Windowless <select/>** &#8211; finally! IE7 redesigned the <select/> control to be windowless, meaning that layers with a higher z-index will go over the control instead of behind it.
  * **Developer&#8217;s Toolbar** &#8211; wonder where they got this idea? In IE7, they are now promising a developer&#8217;s toolbar given developers all kind of information and control over the displayed page. It&#8217;s about time IE developers had something like this.

Of course, we&#8217;ll all have to wait until beta 2 comes out before we can see any of this. Suddenly, I can&#8217;t wait.
