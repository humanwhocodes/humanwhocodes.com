I was asked today to start writing a blog over at <a title="Wrox: Programmer to Programmer" rel="external" href="http://p2p.wrox.com">Wrox&#8217;s P2P site</a>. The hits just keep on coming, I was honored when I was allowed to re-write *Professional JavaScript*, one of the first JavaScript books I ever owned, but now to be asked to be an official blogger over there, I&#8217;m completely overwhelmed.

I&#8217;m not sure how to link directly to my blog, but here&#8217;s a link to my first posting: <a title="Netscape DevEdge: Now you see it, now you don't" rel="external" href="http://p2p.wrox.com/blog.asp?BLOG_ID=44">Netscape DevEdge: Now you see it, now you don&#8217;t</a>. On that page you can find the <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> feed, among other things.

I&#8217;ll continue to keep updating my personal blog here, as well&#8230;certainly can&#8217;t give up my baby, now can I?
