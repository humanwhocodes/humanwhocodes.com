Over the past year or so I&#8217;ve been learning about design patterns and finding them incredibly useful. For languages that have interfaces, it&#8217;s especially useful. Even though JavaScript doesn&#8217;t have such a concept, you can still apply traditional design patterns to the language. As evidence, I&#8217;ve begun writing a series over at <a title="WebReference" rel="external" href="http://www.webreference.com">WebReference</a> covering <a title="Design Patterns in JavaScript, Part 1" rel="external" href="http://webreference.com/r/pg/javascript/ncz/column5/">Design Patterns in JavaScript</a>. I hope everyone enjoys it.
