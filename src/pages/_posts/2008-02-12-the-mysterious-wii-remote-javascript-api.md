I remembered some time ago coming across an <a title="The Wii Remote API" rel="external" href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/the-wii-remote-api/">article</a> over at the <a title="Opera Developer Community" rel="external" href="http://dev.opera.com">Opera Developer Community</a> about a JavaScript API for the Wii remote that was supported in Opera for the Wii. I just went over there tonight and found a mysterious &#8220;access denied&#8221; message on the page. I then found <a title="Wii Remote API" rel="external" href="http://www.pushingbuttons.net/blog/?p=34">this post</a> that showed the links to the article&#8217;s examples still work. Bizarre.

Is the Wii remote JavaScript API really that controversial? If so, someone forgot to tell Nintendo, which posted <a title="Wii Frequently Asked Questions" rel="external" href="http://wii.nintendo.com/wii_faq_internet.jsp">a FAQ</a> containing a bunch of JavaScript information about the Wii remote. There&#8217;s plenty of other references to the Wii JavaScript API out there, as well. So what happened to the original article?
