Being a <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> expert wherever I&#8217;ve worked, I always thought that it was pretty easy. This week, I&#8217;m supposed to be giving a presentation on <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, so I&#8217;ve been working on putting together the Powerpoint slides this weekend. As I&#8217;ve been doing this I realized, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> is really complicated!

I currently have 40 slides and I know there&#8217;s a bunch of stuff I&#8217;m missing. But how can you decide what the most important parts of <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> are when you have only an hour to tell people everything they&#8217;ve ever wanted to know about it?
