Today the company I currently work for, <a title="VistaPrint" rel="external" href="http://www.vistaprint.com">VistaPrint</a>, went public, trading under the <a title="Summary for VistaPrint" rel="external" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vprt">VPRT</a> symbol. This is the first time I&#8217;ve been with a company through an initial public offering. The first company I was at never made it to <acronym title="Initial Public Offering">IPO</acronym>; I joined <a title="MatrixOne" rel="external" href="http://www.matrixone.com">MatrixOne</a> long after they had already <acronym title="Initial Public Offering">IPO</acronym>ed. It&#8217;s sort of an interesting experience.

It&#8217;s very exciting to be sure, to be involved with something like this. Sort of brings back the memories of the dot-com era, where everyone was going public and making a ton of money. I&#8217;m really not sure what to expect from this point on or how the market will react to VistaPrint. To be honest, I&#8217;d sort of lost interest in the stock market since I&#8217;ve only been losing money on it for the past couple of years. This actually gives me a reason to check my stock ticker a little more frequently.
