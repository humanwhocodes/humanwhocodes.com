It's been a long time since I've had the extra time to write some articles. Now that my book is finished, I intend to get back to writing these articles. To that end, the first one is now up over at <a title="WebReference" rel="external" href="http://www.webreference.com">WebReference</a>. This is the first in a three-part series on how to emulate Google Suggest functionality. Check it out: <a title="Creating an Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 1" rel="external" href="http://webreference.com/r/pg/javascript/ncz/">Creating an Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 1</a>.
