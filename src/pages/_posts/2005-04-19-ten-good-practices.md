I came across <a title="Ten good practices for writing JavaScript in 2005" rel="external" href="http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/articles/goodpractices.php">this article</a> earlier today, explaining ten things you should do when writing JavaScript. It's a fairly complete list for having only ten items, and I'm happy to say that I believe my book covers most of these. The others, I think, lend more towards Web site design and enhancement whereas my book is geared more towards professional-level JavaScript solutions.
