As you know, from time to time I write articles for various places on the web. This time, I have a new article up over at <a title="Wrox" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox.com</a> called <a title="Ajax and the Yahoo! Connection Manager" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-291408.html">Ajax and the Yahoo! Connection Manager</a>.

As you probably have guessed from the name, the article explains how to use the <a title="Yahoo! Connection Manager" rel="external" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/index.html">Yahoo! Connection Manager</a>, which is one of the <a title="Yahoo! JavaScript Developer Network" rel="external" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/javascript/">JavaScript libraries</a> Yahoo! just released to the public. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have a chance to dig into some more of the Yahoo! stuff soon. In the meantime, you definitely should!
