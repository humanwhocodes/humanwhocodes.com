Part of the reason that I keep track of the JavaScript links on my site is because I want to keep those links handy for myself (and you thought I was being all altruistic). I've tried to keep myself from creating new lists of links for other technologies as well, lest I become a link library. Thankfully, some people have compiled lists of links relating to other aspects of Web development. One of them, <a title="Bookmarks for Web developers" rel="external" href="http://www.alvit.de/vf/en/essential-bookmarks-for-webdesigners-and-web-developers.html">Bookmarks for Web developers</a>, is perhaps the most comprehensive list of useful Web development links I've ever seen. There's nothing specifically related to JavaScript, but tons of other goodies. Check it out!
