Today started out as a normal day and ended up as being one of the most interesting days in the history of web development.

First, Microsoft <a title="Microsoft's Interoperability Principles and IE8" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/03/microsoft-s-interoperability-principles-and-ie8.aspx">announced a change</a> in the way Internet Explorer 8 will work. Instead of defaulting to IE7&#8242;s rendering mode and forcing developers to opt-in to the &#8220;super standards&#8221; mode, IE8 will now be in super standards mode by default and developers can opt-out to the IE7 rendering mode. This is huge news and somewhat surprising given Microsoft's earlier announcement of how IE8 would work.

Unlike a lot of people, I really didn't have a problem with the original proposal, and I also don't have a problem with this one. I think both show that Microsoft is listening to web developers and is really trying to do the right thing.

The second thing that happened is the release of the <a title="Acid3 Test" rel="external" href="http://acid3.acidtests.org/">Acid3 Test</a>. Unlike previous versions, which tested only CSS compliance, the Acid3 test looks at both CSS and JavaScript behavior in browsers. It looks at DOM Level 2 compliance, CSS 2 and 3, XHTML, and more. This is the next big step in standards compliance for browsers and provides a great tool for all companies to use. It'll be interesting to see which browser wins the Acid3 race.
