One of my personal goals when I moved to California was to get more involved with teaching and presenting. <a title="Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> has been kind enough to give me the opportunity to speak internally, where I give a class on object-oriented JavaScript and, more recently, my talk on <a title="Maintainable JavaScript" rel="external" href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/05/25/video-zakas/">Maintainable JavaScript</a>. They were even nice enough to send me down the Yahoo! office in Santa Monica to talk to them. But how does this help you if you don&#8217;t work at Yahoo!?

I&#8217;m proud to announce that I&#8217;ll be taking my little one-man-show on the road and my first stop will be <a title="The Rich Web Experience" rel="external" href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com">the Rich Web Experience</a> this fall (September 6-8) in San Jose. I&#8217;ll be doing two talks, a reprise of my Maintainable JavaScript talk from Yahoo! (for the first time doing it outside of the company) as well as a new talk on Enterprise JavaScript Error Handling. I know it&#8217;s still early for you to be making plans for the fall, but do keep the dates in mind when you&#8217;re planning your apple picking and leave raking. Special thanks to <a title="Looks Good, Works Well" rel="external" href="http://looksgoodworkswell.blogspot.com/">Bill Scott</a>, a fellow Yahoo! and the one who put me in touch with <a title="No Fluff Just Stuff" rel="external" href="http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com">Jay Zimmerman</a>, the man behind the conference series (oh, and <a title="Adam Platti's Blog" rel="external" href="http://adamplatti.net/blog/">Adam Platti</a> who first introduced me to Bill Scott).
