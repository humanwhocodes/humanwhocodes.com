Recently, <a title="Wrox" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox</a> asked me to write up some excerpts from <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0471777781%2F">Professional Ajax</a> to post online. I thought this was a great idea, since it gives people an idea about the content covered in the book. As a result, the first excerpt, <a title="XMLHttp Requests for Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-291289.html">XMLHttp Requests for Ajax</a> is now available for viewing. It's a basic overview of using XMLHttp in a cross-browser manner. Enjoy!
