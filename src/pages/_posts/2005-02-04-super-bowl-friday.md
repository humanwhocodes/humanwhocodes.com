It&#8217;s the Friday before the Super Bowl, and you know what that means: everyone and their grandmother is making their picks. So, I figure it&#8217;s my time to throw my hat in.

Yes, everyone knows that I&#8217;m picking the Patriots because I&#8217;m from Boston. But my official pick is Patriots over Eagles, 35-10. Whoa, that&#8217;s a big difference in points, you say. Yes, indeed it is. But if the Patriots could hang 41 points on the best defense in the league in Pittsburgh, 35 points doesn&#8217;t seem altogether difficult against a frazzled defense like Philadelphia. Further, I predict at least three touchdown passes for Brady and over 130 yards rushing for Dillon. Oh, and Terrell Owens is going to play, but won&#8217;t have a touchdown reception.
