It's the Friday before the Super Bowl, and you know what that means: everyone and their grandmother is making their picks. So, I figure it's my time to throw my hat in.

Yes, everyone knows that I'm picking the Patriots because I'm from Boston. But my official pick is Patriots over Eagles, 35-10. Whoa, that's a big difference in points, you say. Yes, indeed it is. But if the Patriots could hang 41 points on the best defense in the league in Pittsburgh, 35 points doesn't seem altogether difficult against a frazzled defense like Philadelphia. Further, I predict at least three touchdown passes for Brady and over 130 yards rushing for Dillon. Oh, and Terrell Owens is going to play, but won't have a touchdown reception.
