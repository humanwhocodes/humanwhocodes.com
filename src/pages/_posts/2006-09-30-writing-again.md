So here I am, writing another book. It&#8217;s always really exciting writing a book, planning it, knowing that I&#8217;m writing something that will help people do their jobs. Sometimes I get bored writing about the same topic for 30 or so pages in a row, but every once in a while, I start a chapter with very little idea about what to say. I find these chapters the most exciting, because it means that I need to do research to figure out what to write.

Right now I&#8217;m working on one chapter in particular that has completely taken on a life of its own. My initial outline has been nearly thrown out the window as I&#8217;m discovering more and more useful and cool stuff that I&#8217;m sure everyone will love. I&#8217;m actually excited to see what happens in the rest of the chapter&#8230;and I&#8217;m the one that&#8217;s writing it!

There&#8217;s an old saying about novelists, that they don&#8217;t write their characters, their characters write through the author. Sometimes that&#8217;s how I feel writing about programming, sometimes, it&#8217;s the topic that writes through me.

Any yes, I&#8217;m being purposely vague about the topic. Wouldn&#8217;t want the competition to get wind and try to beat me to the punch, now would I? <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />
