For a while now, I&#8217;ve been trying to get more into the whole &#8220;Mozilla as a platform&#8221; way of life. The problem is that there are no really good all-around references for building an application from start to finish and distributing it as a standalone executable. Yes, there are various pieces of good information scattered about the Internet, but there is no definitive source from which you can learn everything you need to build a Mozilla-based application.

Even the books that are out there are complete disappointments. Most are over a year old, which renders them completely useless since <acronym title="XML User interface Language">XUL</acronym> hasn&#8217;t stopped changing since it was first introduced, rendering all of the examples in these books completely non-functional and useless.

This has been one of my biggest complaints about the Mozilla project for a long time: not enough documentation. I know everyone (well, mostly everyone) is a volunteer, but you can&#8217;t expect the platform to take off without proper documentation. <a title="Eclipse" rel="external" href="http://www.eclipe.org">Eclipse</a> suffers from the exact same problem, as do many open source initiatives&#8230;but come on guys, why can&#8217;t someone just write a book that explains how Firefox is built from start to finish? I&#8217;ve had enough of examples that tell you to load the <acronym title="XML User interface Language">XUL</acronym> file into Mozilla and lovingly look at your creation. How do I compile it into a standalone application? Could someone please write a useful book?
