After planning and planning, I have finally redesigned the site to be fully <acronym title="eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> and <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> compliant.

I&#8217;ve also finally embraced PHP as the technology to run my Web site on. I&#8217;m finally back to using includes and allowing you to send e-mails to me through the site.

You&#8217;ll notice that there are several sections missing, including Projects, FAQ, and Portfolio. I will be reintroducing Projects once I have time to update the entries. FAQ may or may not return. Portfolio will be moved to my professional site once it is completed. Lastly, I&#8217;ll be introducing a new section called Journal where I&#8217;ll be posting extensive journal entries about some of the most interesting experiences I&#8217;ve had in my life.

When I get more time, I&#8217;ll be adding an RSS feed and a way for visitors to add comments to my blog. Can&#8217;t wait, this PHP stuff is great!

Finally, I&#8217;ve added a [contact form][1] so everyone can e-mail me again. Many of you probably noticed that the e-mail address linked on my name doesn&#8217;t work anymore. You can thank over 200 pieces of spam a day for that. So, you can now e-mail me through this form and I don&#8217;t have to worry about spammers getting my e-mail address. Please feel free to use this to contact me.
