When I got home today, there was a large box from <a title="Wiley Publishing" rel="external" href="http://www.wiley.com">Wiley</a>, the kind I usually get when I receive comp copies of the books I wrote. But I had already received all my copies of both books, so I was curious as to what was inside. I opened the box and found five copies of <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764579088/">Professional JavaScript</a>, translated completely <a title="JavaScript Para Desarrolladores Web" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/8441519536/">into Spanish</a>. I nearly fell over laughing. At my last job, Don and I used to try translating technical terms and descriptions into Spanish for fun, and here&#8217;s a whole book! So now my problem is that I don&#8217;t know anyone who knows Spanish *and* wants to learn JavaScript.
