The folks over at <cite>Linux Journal</cite> have named the <a title="Yahoo! User Interface Library" rel="external" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! User Interface (<acronym title="Yahoo! User Interface">YUI</acronym>) Library</a> as the <a title="Editors' Choice 2006" rel="external" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9368">Editors' Choice Software Module or Library for 2006</a>! Congratulations to the team, they're some of the brightest, hardest-working people in the tech industry and they consistently produce quality stuff. Even before I started at <a title="Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>, the <acronym title="Yahoo! User Interface">YUI</acronym> Library was the only JavaScript library <a title="NCZOnline: Yahoo! User Interface Blog" rel="internal" href="/archive/2006/2/304">I've ever recommended</a> to others and I continue to enthusiastically do so.
