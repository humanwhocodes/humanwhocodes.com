Just got a note from George, who runs <a title="JavaScriptKit" rel="external" href="http://www.javascriptkit.com">JavaScriptKit</a> saying that the <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers review" rel="external" href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/jsdeveloperreview.shtml">review of my book</a> is now up. Overall, I&#8217;m pretty happy with his evaluation of the book, which he gave an 8 out of 10. Here&#8217;s an excerpt:

> With the intended reader most likely being familiar with JavaScript already, this book doesn&#8217;t waste any time on pleasantries and hit-and-miss jokes. It is very technical oriented, to the point, and a continuous onslaught of information. And there&#8217;s a lot of information in this book, perhaps providing the most up to date coverage of JavaScript yet.

George does go on to say my examples are &#8220;uninspired&#8221; and &#8220;rigid,&#8221; but I&#8217;ll accept that criticism. It&#8217;s very hard to come up with great examples for any one section when there&#8217;s so much writing to do in a short amount of time. I&#8217;m hoping that if the book does well enough, I&#8217;ll be able to update the examples with more meaningful ones.

But like I said, overall I&#8217;m happy with the review and I thank George for his honest opinion.
