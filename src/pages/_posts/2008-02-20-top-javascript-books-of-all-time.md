I came across <a title="Top JavaScript Books of All Time" rel="external" href="http://octoberblue.com/top-javascript-books-of-all-time/">this link</a> today, naming <a title="Professional JavaScript" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0764579088%2F">Professional JavaScript</a> the 3rd best JavaScript book of all time. I know it&#8217;s not a huge site, but it&#8217;s always nice to know that people like your work. Just wanted to post a thank you to Ryan for his kind words.
