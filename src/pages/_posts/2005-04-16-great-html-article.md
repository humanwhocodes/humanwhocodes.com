If you ask me, the quality of Web development articles online lately has been severely lacking (save for my recent contributions, of course ;-)). With <a title="A List Apart" rel="external" href="http://www.alistapart.com">A List Apart</a> no longer updating, and <a title="WebReference" rel="external" href="http://www.webreference.com">WebReference</a> and <a title="Sitepoint" rel="external" href="http://www.sitepoint.com">Sitepoint</a> having only a small trickle of new content here and there, I've almost stopped looking for new Web development articles daily. Almost.

Today, I came across a great article over at Sitepoint entitled <a title="The Future: HTML or XHTML" rel="external" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/future-html-xhtml">The Future: HTML or XHTML</a>. The author, <a title="Lachy's Log" rel="external" href="http://lachy.id.au/log/">Lachlan Hunt</a>, writes not only about the future of our favorite language, but also about it's beginnings and missteps as well. Included in the article are a nice smattering of useful links to other articles about the topic.

This is one of the best articles I've read online in recent memory, I highly encourage everyone to take a look.
