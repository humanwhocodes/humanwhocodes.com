From time to time, I&#8217;ve blogged about where I saw the issues in web syndication such as <a title="RSS and Syndication Roadblocks" rel="internal" href="{{site.url}}/archive/2005/12/283">verbiage</a> and <a title="RSS and Syndication Roadblocks" rel="internal" href="{{site.url}}/archive/2006/8/372">roadblocks to adoption</a>. Here I am, almost a year after that last post and even though web syndication is incredibly popular, it still amazes me how unintuitive the entire experience can be&#8230;even for web geeks like me. Let me tell you a little story.

Today at work, a fellow Boston sports fan pinged me with news of the <a title="Garnett deal in place" rel="external" href="http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/extras/celtics_blog/2007/07/more_details_on.html">impending Garnett trade</a>. My only sports feed is to the <a title="Reiss' Pieces" rel="external" href="http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/">Reiss&#8217; Pieces Patriots blog</a>, so I was a bit in the dark. I immediately went to <a title="Boston.com" rel="external" href="http://www.boston.com">Boston.com</a> to get more info and decided to subscribe to the Celtics blog. So, I go to the <a title="Celtics" rel="external" href="http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/">Celtics page</a> where I see the little feed icon in Firefox&#8217;s address bar so I know there&#8217;s a feed available. Awesome. I start looking around the page for a &#8220;subscribe&#8221; link&#8230;nowhere to be found. Do you honestly mean that I need to view the source of the page to figure out the subscription URL? I click on the link to the <a title="Celtics Blog" rel="external" href="http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/extras/celtics_blog/">Celtics Blog</a>. Ah, here I find a &#8220;subscribe&#8221; link (even though it does say &#8220;Subscribe via RSS&#8221;, which is still too geeky) but there&#8217;s no feed discovery on this page&#8230;the link in the address bar is nowhere to be found!

Now, I love my <a title="Boston.com" rel="external" href="http://www.boston.com">Boston.com</a>, but this is really sad. The feed discovery tag and a link to subscribe to the feed should be on the same pages, period. I really admired <a title="Boston.com" rel="external" href="http://www.boston.com">Boston.com</a> for catching on with blogs and syndicated feeds so quickly, I really hope that they can pick up on these little implementation details to make the site more usable for feed readers like myself.

Another tidbit: Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if the feed icon in the address bar could be right-clicked to get a menu with selections for &#8220;Copy feed location&#8221; and &#8220;Add to live bookmarks&#8221; along with other options? Maybe someday&#8230;
