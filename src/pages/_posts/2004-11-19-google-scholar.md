My lovely girlfriend, who is a teacher, forwarded me some information today about <a title="Google Scholar" rel="external" href="http://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>, a new search engine by <a title="Google" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> designed to search scholarly articles such as those from peer-reviewed journals.

According to <a title="Google Scholar is Born" rel="external" href="http://www.resourceshelf.com/2004/11/wow-its-google-scholar.html ">ResourceShelf</a>, Google Scholar works by identifying scholarly articles on the Web and searches only those articles. Exactly how Google determines what is a scholarly article is unknown, as is its usefulness compared to more targeted search engines such as <a title="EBSCO" rel="external" href="http://www.ebsco.com">EBSCO</a>, which is used by most colleges and libraries.

Being a current college student (my <acronym title="Master's in Business Administration">MBA</acronym> concludes next May), I find locating scholarly material on non-traditional topics very difficult. I'll be very interested to see if Google can make this process any easier.
