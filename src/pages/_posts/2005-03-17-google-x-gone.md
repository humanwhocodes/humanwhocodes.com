Went back to play with Google X after I posted about it yesterday only to find that it was gone. Google hasn't released as statement as to the reason nor left a notice in its place. You simply get an error message now. What a shame.

Fortunately for me, I actually had Google X loaded in my browser and have still been able to play with it that way. I've looked over the code a few times and it's pretty slick. I'm not convinced that all of the code is actually needed or that it's really an optimal solution to the use case&#8230;seems like the code could be tighter. But, as the <a title="Google goes X" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/03/google-goes-x.html">author said</a>, this started out as a way for him to experiment with JavaScript and learn a little more about it. Well, it certainly is a nice first project!

**Update**: Turns out someone snatched Google X before it was taken down and <a title="Google X" rel="external" href="http://googlex.foxified.info/">posted it</a>.
