For the first time ever, <a title="Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> is opening up its campus to outside developers for a series of seminars and activities called <a title="Hack Day 2006" rel="external" href="http://hackday.org/">Hack Day</a>, which takes place next Friday and Saturday, September 29 and 30. Yahoo! has had internal hack days for a while, but this is your opportunity to be on the campus (legally) and get to interact with some of the best developers in the world.

Before anyone asks, I will not be presenting at Hack Day. There are, however, several excellent seminars and workshops available (<a title="Yahoo! Developer Day Sept. 29: Speaker & Workshop Schedule" rel="external" href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/09/22/yahoo-devday-schedule/">full schedule</a>). I strongly encourage anyone who is capable of doing so to attend (<a title="Yahoo! Hack Day" rel="external" href="http://upcoming.org/event/101629">sign up</a>. I promise you'll learn a lot.
