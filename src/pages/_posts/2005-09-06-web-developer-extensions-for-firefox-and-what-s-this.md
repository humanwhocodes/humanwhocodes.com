Fini Alring posted a nice roundup of the top <a title="Extending Firefox for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.bytefarmers.com/log/2005/09/03/extending-firefox-for-web-developers/">Web development extensions</a> for Firefox. Lots of cool extensions that I didn't even know about, but am very glad to have picked up from this posting. View your headers, edit your cookies&#8230;it's all there.

I noticed one of the things on the list was an extension called <a title="View Rendered Source" rel="external" href="http://www.jennifermadden.com/scripts/ViewRenderedSource.html">View Rendered Source</a>, which sounds eerily similar to my <a title="View DOM Source Bookmarklet" rel="internal" href="https://humanwhocodes.com/archive/2005/3/140">View DOM Source Bookmarklet</a>. Of course, it's entirely possible we came up with the same idea, and I took the easy way out (writing a bookmarklet as opposed to writing an extension). I just like to be attributed if my work inspired someone else, that's all. <img src="https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
