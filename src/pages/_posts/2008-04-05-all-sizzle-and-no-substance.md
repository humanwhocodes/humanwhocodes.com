Not too long ago, I was interviewed by Jennifer deJong of <a title="Software Development Times" rel="external" href="http://www.sdtimes.com">Software Development Times</a> about Ajax, its use and misuse. We had a great conversation about Ajax&#8217;s early missteps and how things have evolved in the past couple of years. One of the main points I wanted to be clear on, as I try to be whenever possible, is that Ajax is not a feature. You should never be saying, &#8220;how can we use Ajax?&#8221; You should be designing the best user experience possible and if Ajax helps with that goal, then use it.

My thoughts, along with a host of other industry experts, are summarized and tied together nicely in Jennifer&#8217;s article, <a title="All sizzle and no substance?" rel="external" href="http://www.sdtimes.com/content/article.aspx?ArticleID=31815">All Sizzle and No Substance?</a>. There&#8217;s a lot of good perspectives on Ajax pain points as well as what to do and avoid.
