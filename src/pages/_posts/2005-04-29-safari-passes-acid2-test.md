In the race that really featured only one runner, Safari is the first browser to correctly render the <a title="Acid2 Test" rel="external" href="http://webstandards.org/act/acid2/">Acid2 Test</a>. The <a title="Safari Passes the Acid2 Test (Updated)" rel="external" href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2005_04.html#008042">announcement</a> was made nearly two days ago&#8230;apparently proving that my <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> reader isn&#8217;t working correctly. Safari developer Dave Hyatt really took to the task, providing almost daily updates over the past couple of weeks, trying to work out all the bugs for Safari 2.0. Congratulations, Dave, on a job well done!

We still have yet to see or hear anything from other browser companies. Opera, who <a title="The Acid2 challenge to Microsoft" rel="external" href="http://news.com.com/The+Acid2+challenge+to+Microsoft/2010-1032_3-5618723.html?tag=nefd.ac">initially challenged</a> Microsoft to pass the Acid2 test has not only <a title="Opera Acid2 Screenshot" rel="external" href="http://home.student.uu.se/dana3949/temp/acid2/opera7.png">failed it</a> themselves, but are busy planning for their <acronym title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</acronym> to <a title="Opera's CEO will swim from Norway to the USA" rel="external" href="http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2005/04/21/">swim the Atlantic</a>. Firefox also <a title="Firefox Acid2 Screenshot" rel="external" href="http://home.student.uu.se/dana3949/temp/acid2/firefox1.0.png">failed</a> the test but is <a title="Bugzilla: Mozilla doesn't pass the acid2 (acid 2) test" rel="external" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289480">making some progress</a> towards fixing it. The big question is if the folks at Microsoft are going to try to fix the next version of Internet Explorer to fully support the test.
