I arrived at the hotel last night for the Ajax Experience (I term this &#8220;day 0&#8243; because the conference officially started today. The Renaissance Hotel is really nice and somehow I ended up with a room that has two beds&#8230;party in my room! The room had a nice TV, about 42&#8243; with HD, so watching ESPN was a lot of fun.

Since football was on, I headed down to the bar to watch amongst other fans. I ran into fellow Yahoos Chris Heilmann and Nicole Sullivan while there, which was nice because I hadn't seen a familiar face since I arrived. I also chatted with a few conference-goers&#8230;sadly both Giants fans&#8230;at the bar while watching the game. Aside from the gratuitous Crockford-love being showered over me, it was a nice way to end up the first night in town.

My first talk isn't until Tuesday, so Monday is looking like a day to relax, sleep in, and see how many interesting people I can run into.
