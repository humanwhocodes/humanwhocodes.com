One my frequent delusions is that I somehow come up with a wonderful <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> for JavaScript. To that end, I often go hunting for open source <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym>s to take a look at the code and see how they're built. On pretty impressive one I came across is <a title="SharpDevelop" rel="external" href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/">SharpDevelop</a>, an <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> written for C# and VB.NET development.

<a title="SharpDevelop" rel="external" href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/">SharpDevelop</a> was created as an example of how to create a high-powered <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> using C# for the old Wrox Press book, <a title="Dissecting a C# Application: Inside SharpDevelop" rel="external" href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/InsideSharpDevelop.aspx">Dissecting a C# Application: Inside SharpDevelop</a>. As I went to look up the book, I found that, since Wrox Press is no more (my book is technically published by <a title="John Wiley and Sons Publishing" rel="external" href="http://www.wiley.com">Wiley</a>, who bought some of the Wrox assets, including some of their titles), the book has been made available for free through <a title="Apress" rel="external" href="http://www.apress.com">Apress</a>, who reserved the copyright for all the books Wiley didn't buy the rights to.

You can <a title="Free EBook" rel="external" href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/InsideSharpDevelopBook/ApressDownloads.aspx">download the entire book and SharpDevelop's source code</a>. I've just started reading it, and this is great. It basically shows you how to create an <acronym title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</acronym> that looks and acts like Visual Studio! Kudos to the authors, and thanks to Apress for making it free.
