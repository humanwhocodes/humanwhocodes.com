Just a quick note to let everyone know I&#8217;ll be speaking at the [San Francisco JavaScript Meetup][1] next Tuesday, November 25. I&#8217;m going to be speaking about why the new [Yahoo! Front Page][2] is built on [YUI 3.0][3]. This seems to have been a very hot topic after my [YUIBlog post][4], so the YUI team asked if I would go and explain a little more in person. The talks at the Meetup are quite short, about ten minutes, so this will be quite different for me. Creating a talk for ten minutes is completely different than making one that&#8217;s supposed to go for an hour. The question is, can you fit everything into just ten minutes? I guess I&#8217;ll find out. Hope to see you there!
