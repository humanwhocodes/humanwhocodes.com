There&#8217;s been a lot of hype lately around Microsoft&#8217;s <a title="The Atlas Project" rel="external" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/06/28/416185.aspx">Atlas Project</a> the past few days. For those unaware, this is Microsoft&#8217;s promise of delivering components for enabling <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> solutions for Web developers. They promise it will be part of ASP.NET 2.0 with special server-side components and a client-side JavaScript library providing all kinds of functionality.

I don&#8217;t know why everyone is so excited about this, it&#8217;s not like Microsoft hasn&#8217;t given us client-side components before. Anyone remember the <a title="Using the WebService Behavior" rel="external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/webservice/using.asp">WebService behavior</a>? Of course, the security updates to Internet Explorer regarding cross-domain communication pretty much rendered that useless.

In any event, even though Atlas will work cross-browser (allegedly), why would anyone switch from their custom-made solution to Atlas? Frameworks are notoriously difficult to make because you&#8217;re trying to solve general use cases instead of specific ones. This is why I&#8217;ve never sat down to try to write one of the JavaScript libraries that seem to get popular every once in a while. I&#8217;m a much bigger fan of small components that can easily be implemented into any page rather than entire frameworks that you are required to use to get certain functionality. I&#8217;ll be sticking with my own stuff for now.
