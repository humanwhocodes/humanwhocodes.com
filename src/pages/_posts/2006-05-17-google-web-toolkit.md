Got an e-mail from <a title="Lonnie Best" rel="external" href="http://www.lonniebest.com">Lonnie</a> this afternoon pointing out Google&#8217;s latest creation: <a title="Google Web Toolkit - Build AJAX apps in the Java language" rel="external" href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>. The is interesting: write all of your JavaScript code as Java first, to take advantage of all of the tools available for Java, then convert it to JavaScript as the final step for deployment.

I think it&#8217;s an intriguing concept, but not so sure how I feel about being kept so far away from the JavaScript layer. Am I to assume that the Google Web Toolkit is going to be constantly and consistently updated to provide for all the different browser quirks? Putting too many layers of abstract between me and my JavaScript always makes me nervous. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the final outputted code, how can you debug it when something fails? I think the jury is out on this development; let&#8217;s see if it gets any traction.
