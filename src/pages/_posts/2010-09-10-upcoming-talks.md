In short order, I&#8217;m going to be giving a bunch of talks at various places in the universe, and am both excited and a little bit overwhelmed by the upcoming schedule. A lot of people don&#8217;t realize that I&#8217;m not an evangelist &#8211; it&#8217;s not my job to go to conferences or prepare talks. I&#8217;m usually plenty busy keeping one of the [world&#8217;s most-visited web sites][1] up and running, accessible, and fast. I do feel that it&#8217;s important to share knowledge about how to develop at scale, and so I frequently find myself giving talks to help spread the word.

The next couple of months will be fairly hectic, but I wanted to share the schedule in the hopes that I&#8217;ll meet many of you soon.

## WebDirections USA

My first stop in my whirlwind tour is [WebDirections USA][2] in Atlanta. I&#8217;ve never been to Atlanta before, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to the trip. I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of conversing with Maxine Sherrin the past couple of months, and I&#8217;ve heard wonderful things about the conference in general. This will be the first conference I&#8217;ve presented at that is a mix of design and development topics. I&#8217;ll be talking about [High Performance JavaScript][3], based on some of the parts of my book by the same name. If you haven&#8217;t yet bought your tickets, use the discount code WDUSA-ZAKAS to get a few dollars off.

## Google

Last year I met Bryan McQuade of PageSpeed fame at Velocity. We&#8217;ve been talking off and on about me dropping by when I&#8217;m in the area. Since I&#8217;m going to be in Boston the week after WebDirections USA, I&#8217;m going to swing by the Google office in Cambridge for a talk about web performance. I&#8217;ll be covering a mix of topics, including parts of my Velocity talk from this year (Performance on the Yahoo! Homepage) as well as parts of High Performance JavaScript. It&#8217;s really cool to see web development alive and well back in my old stomping grounds.

## Fronteers

Perhaps the biggest deal for me is a trip to Amsterdam to speak at [Fronteers][4]. I&#8217;m excited about this because, believe it or not, I&#8217;ve never been outside of the United States before. Thanks to Peter Slagter and Krijn Hoetmer for helping with all of the arrangements. One of the things I love about Fronteers is that it&#8217;s not-for-profit, so every penny taken in goes back out to the speakers and attendees. They certainly wouldn&#8217;t be able to import the incredible list of speakers otherwise! I&#8217;ll be speaking in Dutch on the topic of [High Performance JavaScript][5]. Just kidding, I can&#8217;t speak Dutch. Yet.

## YUIConf

In November, I&#8217;ll have finally made my way back to California and will be speaking at [YUIConf][6]. For the <del>first time ever</del> second straight year, we&#8217;ll be inviting the outside world onto the Yahoo! campus to learn about YUI &#8211; this time, with more seats available. Prices are scandalously low to reserve your seat to hear from some of the top front end minds at Yahoo!. I&#8217;ll be putting down my performance hat and slipping into my testing gloves with a talk on JavaScript testing with a focus on continuous integration (CI) environments. Also, I&#8217;ll be making a big announcement about [YUI Test][7] as part of my talk. You won&#8217;t want to miss it.

## Hope to see you there!

I usually only go where I&#8217;m invited because I&#8217;m usually too busy to seek out speaking opportunities, so if you would like to see me somewhere in particular, be sure to let me or the organizers know. I&#8217;m going to be in the Boston area the week of September 26 and the week of October 11. If there are any web development events or you&#8217;d just like to meet up and talk about the related topics, do get in touch &#8211; I&#8217;d be happy to oblige (schedule permitting, of course).

After YUIConf, I plan on taking some time off from speaking through the end of the year, so please be sure to say hi if you see me out and about. And I hope to see a lot of you at these various events soon.

**Update (10-Sep-2010): **Thanks to Jenny and Craig for pointing out this is the second year that YUIConf is open to the public. Last year I was recovering from surgery so wasn&#8217;t too involved. <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
