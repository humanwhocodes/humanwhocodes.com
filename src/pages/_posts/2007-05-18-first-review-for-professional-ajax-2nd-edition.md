Stephen Chapman, the <a title="JavaScript Guide" rel="external" href="http://javascript.about.com">JavaScript guide</a>, has posted a <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://javascript.about.com/od/reviews/gr/ajax2.htm">great review</a> of <a title="Professional Ajax, 2nd Edition" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProfessional-Ajax-2nd-Nicholas-Zakas%2Fdp%2F0470109491%2F&tag=nczonline-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Professional Ajax, 2nd Edition</a>. From his review:

> A book for the programmer with a good knowledge of Javascript, XML, and at least one server side language wanting to combine these skills to produce client/server web applications. Provided that you have a sufficient understanding of programming to follow the examples, this book will introduce you to the real future of client/server interaction on the web as well as providing you with some of the tools that will make implementing this type of interaction much easier. A must have book for anyone wanting to use Ajax.

Hopefully, this is the first of many good reviews. Speaking of which, if you&#8217;re someone with a high-traffic, tech-related web site (or someone who contributes to one such as <a title="Slashdot" rel="external" href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>), drop me a line if you&#8217;d like to review the book. Reviews on [Amazon][1] are also appreciated.
