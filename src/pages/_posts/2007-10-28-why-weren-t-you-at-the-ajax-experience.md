Just thought I&#8217;d post a note before anyone else asks me this question: why weren&#8217;t you at the Ajax Experience? I mean, especially since it was in Boston??? Both good questions. To answer the second one first, I live in California now, so it&#8217;s not like I can just pop over. To answer the first question, I wasn&#8217;t there because I wasn&#8217;t invited and there wasn&#8217;t an opportunity to submit talks this time around. I&#8217;m pretty open to speaking engagements, so if you&#8217;d like to see me at one, you can either let me know how to submit a talk proposal or put pressure on the organizers to contact me. <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
