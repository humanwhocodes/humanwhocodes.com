Just thought I'd post a note before anyone else asks me this question: why weren't you at the Ajax Experience? I mean, especially since it was in Boston??? Both good questions. To answer the second one first, I live in California now, so it's not like I can just pop over. To answer the first question, I wasn't there because I wasn't invited and there wasn't an opportunity to submit talks this time around. I'm pretty open to speaking engagements, so if you'd like to see me at one, you can either let me know how to submit a talk proposal or put pressure on the organizers to contact me. <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
