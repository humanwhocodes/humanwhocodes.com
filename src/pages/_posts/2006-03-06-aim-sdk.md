After so many years of people hacking into the <acronym title="America Online">AOL</acronym> instant messaging service, apparently they&#8217;ve had enough and want to help people do it. <acronym title="America Online">AOL</acronym> has just released the <a title="AIM Software Development Kit" rel="external" href="http://developer.aim.com"><acronym title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</acronym> Software Development Kit</a> so you can create your own instant messaging client using the service. But don&#8217;t get any <a title="Cerulean Studios" rel="external" href="http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/">Trillian</a>-type ideas in your head; the <a title="AIM SDK License" rel="external" href="http://developer.aim.com/license.jsp">license agreement</a> strictly prohibits using the <acronym title="Software Development Kit">SDK</acronym> in programs that also access other services:

> Further, in addition to any other restrictions contained in this Agreement or in the applicable Addenda to this Agreement, you shall not use any Tool to, and your Application shall not, enable (a) direct communication (e.g., presence data, text, video, VoIP, file transfers, or data exchanges) between the AOL Services and any other instant messaging community or third party instant messaging services, or (b) an end user the ability to access any other instant messaging client and / or community (e.g., no multi-headed clients).

Might still be worth playing around with. Clearly, <acronym title="America Online">AOL</acronym> is scared of losing its instant messaging market dominance and is relying on the universe of programmers to help keep it on top.
