Since I've started tinkering with <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym>, I've been using a plain text editor to code up my pages. As I've mentioned before, I use <a title="Eclipse" rel="external" href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> for Java development, so I was psyched to see that there actually is a <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> plugin called <a title="PHPeclipse" rel="external" href="http://www.phpeclipse.de">PHPeclipse</a>.

This thing looks like it's the real deal. It includes code insight dropdowns, syntax highlighting, debugging, and the ability to control <a title="Apache" rel="external" href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a> and <a title="MySQL" rel="external" href="http://www.mysql.org">MySQL</a> from within Eclipse. Pretty cool if you ask me.
