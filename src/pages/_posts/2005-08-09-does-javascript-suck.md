It&#8217;s not often that I&#8217;m moved to post a long response to anyone&#8217;s blog, but I came across a post entitled <a title="JavaScript sucks (volume 1)" rel="external" href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/06/02/javascript-sucks-volume-1/">JavaScript sucks (volume 1)</a> that made me jump to action (<a title="JavaScript sucks (volume 1) - My comment" rel="external" href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/06/02/javascript-sucks-volume-1/#comment-2539">my comment here</a>). There seems to be more and more people bashing JavaScript nowadays; not really sure why. Afterall, what better time is there to be a JavaScript developer than right now?

As with most articles dissing JavaScript, this one suffers from a lack of information about the way the language is intended to work. One might even say that the author would benefit from reading a certain book written by&#8230;me. It&#8217;s too bad JavaScript is still so misunderstood. It is really a very powerful language, but just like every language, it has its quirks.
