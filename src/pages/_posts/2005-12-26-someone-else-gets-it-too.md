After my last posting garnered such a small response, I was heartened to see <a title="Feed Icons" rel="external" href="http://www.feedicons.com">this site</a> pop up in a blog posting over at <a title="ForgetFoo" rel="external" href="http://www.forgetfoo.com">Foo&#8217;s place</a>. If you stop over, <a title="The New Standard Feed Icon" rel="external" href="http://mattbrett.com/archives/2005/12/the-new-standard-feed-icon/">this guy</a> says essentially the exact same thing. In any event, at the site you can download template files to make your own feed icons (I did it the old-fashioned way, though). Hopefully this movement will continue!
