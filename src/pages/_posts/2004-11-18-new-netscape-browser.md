Just when you thought it was safe to proclaim the original Netscape/Microsoft browser war over, Netscape has <a title="Netscape aims beyond Firefox" rel="external" href="https://news.com.com/Netscape+aims+beyond+Firefox/2100-1032_3-5457251.html?part=rss&tag=5457251&subj=news.1032.20">announced</a> that it will release an all-new browser (the name of the browser wasn't released) based on Mozilla technology.

Netscape, which is now a unit of <acronym title="America Online">AOL</acronym>, has done little more than re-brand the Mozilla browser in the past couple of years. This time, Netscape claims, will be different. They say that this all-new browser will be more than just a re-branded Mozilla&#8230;I guess only time will tell. The question is, will anyone care since <a rel="external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> has become so popular?
