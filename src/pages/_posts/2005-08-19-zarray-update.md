Thanks to an earlier comment, I&#8217;ve updated the `every()` method of the zArray library to match what it should do (return true for an empty array). I also added a couple of other methods I found while digging through my old files: `append()`, which is logically equivalent to `push()`, and `sum()`, which returns the sum of all the items in the array (the sum can be a string or a number). The update brings zArray to version 1.1 and is available now in the <a title="NCZOnline - Downloads" rel="internal" href="/downloads/">Downloads</a> section.
