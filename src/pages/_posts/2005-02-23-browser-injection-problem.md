One of the guys at work forwarded <a title="Multiple Browsers Window Injection Vulnerability Test" rel="external" href="http://secunia.com/multiple_browsers_window_injection_vulnerability_test/">this link</a> to me today. This vulnerability involves a new form of code injection. Basically, if I were to open up a window to an external site from my site, it's possible for me to hijack one (or more) of the links on that site and make it go wherever I want. Try out the test for yourself, it's really creepy.
