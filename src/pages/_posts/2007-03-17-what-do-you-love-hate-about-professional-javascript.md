Will all the excitement over the release of <a title="Professional Ajax, Second Edition" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProfessional-Ajax-2nd-Nicholas-Zakas%2Fdp%2F0470109491%2F&tag=nczonline-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Professional Ajax, 2nd Edition</a>, I didn't want people to think that I was leaving my first book, <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0764579088%2F">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a> behind. In fact, I'm now going through it to figure out what should and shouldn't be in a second edition. To aid in this decision, I'd like to ask you. Basically, I'd like to know answers to these questions:

  * What did you like about the book?
  * What did you hate about the book?
  * What were your three favorite chapters?
  * What were your three least favorite chapters?
  * Are there any chapters that should be removed?
  * What's missing from the book?

Feel free to leave these as comments on this blog post or to email me directly. Either way, I want to know what you think so that the next edition of <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0764579088%2F">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</a> will be as helpful to you, if not moreso, than the first.
