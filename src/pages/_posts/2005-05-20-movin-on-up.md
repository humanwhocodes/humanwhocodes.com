I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s been going on, but in the past week my book has really taken off at Amazon.com, even making it up as high as #1,666 out of all books. What does that ranking mean? Not a clue, but I assume the lower the number, the better. This is also the fourth straight week that I&#8217;ve checked in on it and seen that there&#8217;s only one copy left in stock. Of course, Amazon reorders stuff pretty quickly, so that never stays up very long. But I still feel like I need to thank everybody that&#8217;s been buying the book. I&#8217;ve been repeatedly humbled by the responses I&#8217;ve gotten. Please keep that feedback coming!
