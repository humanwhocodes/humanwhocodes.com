I'm not sure what's been going on, but in the past week my book has really taken off at Amazon.com, even making it up as high as #1,666 out of all books. What does that ranking mean? Not a clue, but I assume the lower the number, the better. This is also the fourth straight week that I've checked in on it and seen that there's only one copy left in stock. Of course, Amazon reorders stuff pretty quickly, so that never stays up very long. But I still feel like I need to thank everybody that's been buying the book. I've been repeatedly humbled by the responses I've gotten. Please keep that feedback coming!
