As many of you know, I&#8217;ve been re-writing Wrox Press&#8217; *Professional JavaScript* from scratch. This process has taken nearly two years and is nearing its end. I have tried to make this into the JavaScript book that I believe developers have been waiting for.

I&#8217;m currently looking for JavaScript developers to review the book before it comes out in spring of 2005. My hope is that this process will provide high-quality feedback as well as helping to spread the word about the book. If you&#8217;re interested, please <a title="Reviewer Application" rel="internal" href="/writing/reviewers/">let me know</a>.
