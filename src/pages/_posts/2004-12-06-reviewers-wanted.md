As many of you know, I've been re-writing Wrox Press' *Professional JavaScript* from scratch. This process has taken nearly two years and is nearing its end. I have tried to make this into the JavaScript book that I believe developers have been waiting for.

I'm currently looking for JavaScript developers to review the book before it comes out in spring of 2005. My hope is that this process will provide high-quality feedback as well as helping to spread the word about the book. If you're interested, please <a title="Reviewer Application" rel="internal" href="/writing/reviewers/">let me know</a>.
