Just wanted to post a quick note that [Eric Miraglia][1] has posted a [sample excerpt][2] from [<cite>Professional JavaScript, 2nd Edition</cite>][3] over at the [YUIBlog][4]. The excerpt comes from a chapter called <cite>Advanced Techniques</cite>, in which I explain, well, advanced JavaScript techniques including function currying, advanced timers, and more techniques that every professional front end engineer should know. Some of Eric&#8217;s kind words:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Personally, Iâ€™ve found this to be a particularly useful book for engineers coming into frontend engineering or professionalizing their practice. Weâ€™ve used the first edition for three years in internal classes taught at Yahoo, and the second edition is even better than the first.
</p>

Eric also wrote a [great foreword][5] for the book. Thanks to Eric for posting the excerpt and to my editor, [Jim Minatel][6], for okaying and providing the excerpt.

P.S. There&#8217;s also a [Facebook page][7] for the book. If you like it, sign up to be a fan!
