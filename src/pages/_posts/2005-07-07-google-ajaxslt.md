Those hackers over at Google are at it again. Seems that they&#8217;ve created both an XPath parser and <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Transformations">XSLT</acronym> engine written completely in JavaScript. The project is called <a title="Google AJAXSLT" rel="external" href="http://goog-ajaxslt.sourceforge.net/">Google AJAXSLT</a>, which is sort of a weird name, but lends itself to the belief that it will be useful (and necessary) for <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> applications.

Apparently, this Google AJAXSLT is used to make <a title="Google Maps" rel="external" href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> work on browsers that don&#8217;t support client-side <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Transformations">XSLT</acronym> such as Opera. Now, they&#8217;ve released it to open source for all the world to play with.
