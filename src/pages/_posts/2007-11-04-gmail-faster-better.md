It was a couple of days ago when I noticed something strange in my RSS reader: <a title="Dan Pupius" rel="external" href="http://www.pupius.co.uk">Dan Pupius</a> had posted a blog entry. The entry was a simple sentence that pointed to <a title="Code changes to prepare Gmail for the future" rel="external" href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2007/10/code-changes-to-prepare-gmail-for.html">his post on the Gmail blog</a> about code changes that were being rolled out. I had the pleasure of speaking with Dan way back when I interviewed with Google. I was impressed then, as he&#8217;s a really bright guy, and am even more impressed now.

Dan doesn&#8217;t blog very often, but when he does, it&#8217;s usually something important and/or extremely useful. This case is no different. The changes to Gmail are quite impressive; it feels to me that the app is moving about three times faster than before. The clicks are ultra-responsive now, as opposed to the familiar interaction delays I grew used to. Congratulations to Dan and the whole Gmail team, performance improvements like this don&#8217;t occur without a lot of work and attention to detail.
