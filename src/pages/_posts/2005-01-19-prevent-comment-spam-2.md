After a lot of <a title="Google aims to outsmart search tricksters" rel="external" href="http://news.com.com/Google+aims+to+outsmart+search+tricksters/2100-1024_3-5540740.html?part=rss&tag=5540740&subj=news.1024.20">hype</a>, Google announced yesterday on <a title="Preventing comment spam" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html">its blog</a> how it plans to eliminate comment spam links from being indexed. The simple answer is to have blog owners (and those who write blogging tools) set `rel="nofollow"` on all links submitted by users.

Seems easy enough to do, and there&#8217;s a whole slew of blogging applications that have already agreed to do it. Hopefully, this will discourage comment spammers (considering that this site has received more comment spam than regular comments).
