I was reading through some forums earlier today when someone posted a question asking how to force Internet Explorer to print something in landscape mode instead of portrait. I didn&#8217;t think it was possible, but apparently it is. Using some <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, you can effectively <a title="Force Specific Content to Print in Landscape Orientation" rel="external" href="http://web.tampabay.rr.com/bmerkey/examples/landscape-test.html">mimic landscape printing</a> in IE (bummer that it doesn&#8217;t work in Firefox).
