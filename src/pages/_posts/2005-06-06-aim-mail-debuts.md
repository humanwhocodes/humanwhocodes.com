I was just reading over at <a title="CNet News" rel="external" href="http://www.news.com">News.com</a> that the new <acronym title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</acronym> mail service <a title="AIM e-mail debuts" rel="external" href="http://news.com.com/AIM+e-mail+debuts/2100-1038_3-5733583.html?tag=nefd.top">debuted today</a>. So, in typical geek fashion, I hightailed it on over to check it out.

I find the interface pretty interesting. It&#8217;s simple and uncomplicated (unlike the <acronym title="American Online">AOL</acronym> desktop application). The only noise comes from the omnipresent banner ad that lives in the middle of the screen. There&#8217;s a lot of JavaScript behind the scenes: a browser sniffer, hidden iframes&#8230;all kinds of good <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> stuff. As an added bonus, most of the JavaScript code isn&#8217;t obfuscated (though comments have obviously been stripped) so it&#8217;s easy to see exactly what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes.

The one major downfall in the interface, in my opinion, is the use of popup windows. What made GMail my favorite was that it didn&#8217;t use any popup windows. <acronym title="AOL Instant Messenger">AIM</acronym> mail uses popups for a variety of things. Still, you can&#8217;t help but admire the cleanliness of what was seemingly a Mac-inspired user interface design. With cool features like an away message, it very well could end up giving GMail a run for its money.
