Now into the second big weekend of writing the new *Professional Ajax* book, I&#8217;m getting pretty excited. I think this book is really going to blow every away. I, <a title="XWeb" rel="external" href="http://www.wdonline.com">Jeremy</a>, and Joe (Fawcett) have some really great stuff planned. I&#8217;ve been skipping around a bit (as I typically do), but I&#8217;m currently doing a re-work of the <a title="Creating an Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 1" rel="external" href="http://webreference.com/r/pg/javascript/ncz/">autosuggest</a> <a title="Creating an Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 2" rel="external" href="http://webreference.com/r/pg/javascript/ncz/column2/">control</a> <a title="Creating an Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 3" rel="external" href="http://webreference.com/r/pg/javascript/ncz/column3/">I designed</a> for <a title="WebReference" rel="external" href="http://www.webreference.com">Web Reference</a>, which is turning out to be really cool. It addresses some of the concerns readers posed to me over typing too fast, and adds database functionality. If I&#8217;m getting excited just writing about it, I&#8217;m hoping everyone else out there will be excited when they read it.
