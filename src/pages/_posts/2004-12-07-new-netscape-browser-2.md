From the files of &#8220;just when you thought it was safe to proclaim Netscape dead&#8221;, a new Netscape browser built on the <a title="Mozilla Firefox" rel="external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> codebase <a title="First Look at Firefox-Based Netscape" rel="external" href="https://www.mozillazine.org/articles/article5691.html">is being shown around</a> in prototype form.

The browser offers several unique features, such as the ability view the given Web site in Internet Explorer using Microsoft's Web Browser component (it is just an ActiveX control, afterall). Other browser features include a weirdly organized toolbar and menubar (the menus are all aligned to the right?). I suppose in order to innovate you have to try something no else is doing&#8230;but perhaps no one is doing it because it's a crappy idea.
