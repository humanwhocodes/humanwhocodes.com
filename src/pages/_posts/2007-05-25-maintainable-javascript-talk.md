Way back in March, <a title="Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> held its internal Front End Engineering Summit at the Sunnyvale campus (my base of operations). At the Summit, I gave a presentation on what I like to call Maintainable JavaScript. The good news is that it was videotaped and is now available over at the <a title="YUI Theater - Nicholas Zakas - Maintainable JavaScript" rel="external" href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/05/25/video-zakas/">YUI Blog</a>.

The idea behind Maintainable JavaScript is that there are many ways to write code, but in an enterprise environment your priority should be on maintainability (versus strictly performance or adherence to particular programming paradigms). The talk describes things you can do to make your code more maintainable as well as things you should avoid; I hope you enjoy this talk.
