It&#8217;s that time again. I&#8217;ve started work on the second edition of Professional JavaScript and I&#8217;d like to get some feedback from my fellow developers as I go along. Here&#8217;s the way it works: I&#8217;ve setup a <a title="Books of Nicholas C. Zakas" rel="external" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/zakasbooks/">Yahoo! group</a> at which I&#8217;ll be posting copies of the new chapters. Members of this group agree to:

  1. Read at least one chapter.
  2. Provide feedback on each chapter within two weeks.
  3. Not share the content with anyone outside of the group (it is copyrighted, afterall)!

Anyone who provides quality feedback for at least one chapter will be mentioned by name in the book&#8217;s Acknowledgments; anyone providing quality feedback for at least five chapters will get a free copy of the book when it is released.

If you&#8217;re interested, hop on over to the <a title="Books of Nicholas C. Zakas" rel="external" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/zakasbooks/">group</a> and request membership. Tell me a little about why you&#8217;ll be a great reviewer. I&#8217;m really looking forward to writing this book and hope that there&#8217;s enough people interested in giving quality feedback that this little experiment can continue in the future.
