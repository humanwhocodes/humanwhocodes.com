The <a title="Creating an Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 3" rel="external" href="http://webreference.com/r/pg/javascript/ncz/column3/">last part</a> of the three-part article series on creating an autosuggest textbox is now available over at <a title="WebReference" rel="external" href="http://www.webreference.com">WebReference</a>. I apologize for the long delay as I had no control over when the article would get published; I only pass it in and the editors decide when it runs. But hey, it's not like I'm George Lucas and waited 20 years to publish the last part. <img src="https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
