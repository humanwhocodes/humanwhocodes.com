Just thought I&#8217;d reassure everyone that I still love my job at <a title="Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a>. Why am I saying this? Because it seems like everytime I turn around, someone is asking if I regret choosing Yahoo! over <a title="Google" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. Yes, the Yahoo! stock has taken a beating lately and Google successfully bought <a title="YouTube" rel="external" href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, but does that make working at Yahoo! any less exciting? No way.

I love my job at Yahoo!, love the people I work with, love the company. Is it perfect? Of course not, no job ever is. But I&#8217;ve never thought I made the wrong choice. And would I recommend Yahoo! to others? Of course I would. There&#8217;s so much cool stuff going on, I constantly feel lucky to be surrounded by such smart, talented people. I feel like I&#8217;ve learned so much in the short time I&#8217;ve been here. I have no doubt that this is exactly where I&#8217;m supposed to be right now. Yodelling.
