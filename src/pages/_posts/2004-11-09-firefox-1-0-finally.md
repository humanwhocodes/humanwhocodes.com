Today is the much anticipated release of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox" rel="external">Firefox 1.0</a>. Of course, if you can actually download it, since the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" rel="external">Mozilla site</a> isn't handling the spike in traffic all that well. I tried for a couple of hours before finally getting the installer to download.

As expected, there's not a lot of big changes from the preview releases. They finally added a "Go" button next to the address bar, which I like, and they changed the RSS icon in the lower right corner to non-text based (maybe because people thought the new RSS icon looked like "ASS"). Other than that, I'm just happy to know that I'm using an official 1.0 browser that's pretty damn cool.
