I just spent the past four hours going through each and every book example to find the ones that didn&#8217;t work. A lot of the issues were easily traced to missing files or incorrectly named files. Others were most likely copy and paste errors. In any event, I&#8217;ve posted the updated examples in the <a title="Downloads" rel="internal" href="/downloads">Downloads</a> section. They should be up on the <a title="Wrox Press" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox</a> site later this week.
