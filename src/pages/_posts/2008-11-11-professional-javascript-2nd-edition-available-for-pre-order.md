Good news! [Professional JavaScript, 2nd Edition][1] is now available for pre-order from Amazon. This is my fourth book release in the past five years, and boy am I tired. I&#8217;m very excited about this book as it represents my revisiting of the book that started it all for me. The first edition of <cite>Professional JavaScript</cite> was both a labor of love and my introduction into the world of technical books. I&#8217;ve learned a lot since then, both technically and in terms of my writing, so this book represents all the additional knowledge I&#8217;ve acquired in the past five years.

So why would you want to buy this version if you already bought the first? Quite simply, because a lot has changed since the first book came out. You should buy this book if you want to learn:

  * All the latest techniques for object-oriented programming in JavaScript, including Crockford&#8217;s design patterns.
  * What happens behind-the-scenes in the JavaScript engine in terms of how objects are related to their prototypes, memory usage, and garbage collection.
  * ECMAScript 4 and its successor, ECMAScript 3.1.
  * The quirks in the JavaScript implementations of various browsers, including Google Chrome, Safari 3.1, Firefox 3, and Internet Explorer 8.
  * Best practices for development, performance, coding style, maintainability, and deployment.
  * Cross-domain Ajax requests in Internet Explorer and Firefox.
  * How JavaScript works on web-enabled devices such as the iPhone and Wii.
  * The latest features of HTML 5 and which parts have already been implemented.

<cite>Professional JavaScript, 2nd Edition</cite>, took me over a year to complete. All the while, new browsers kept being released, so I hope everyone can appreciate just how up-to-date this book will be when it hits shelves in January. I look forward to hearing your feedback very soon!
