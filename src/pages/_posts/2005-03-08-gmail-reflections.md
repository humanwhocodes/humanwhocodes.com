Now that the hype is over, I finally was able to procure an invite to join <a title="GMail" rel="external" href="http://www.gmail.com">GMail</a> from my new buddy, <a title="Bradley Baumann" rel="external" href="http://bradbaumann.blogspot.com/">Bradley</a>. And I must say, they have a very interesting approach to Web-based e-mail.

I won&#8217;t get into how it works, since numerous articles have been written about it. I will say that the liberal use of JavaScript makes GMail much more usable than most Webmail programs. I admire the use of iframes to allow the back and forward buttons to still work while maintaining the &#8220;never reload&#8221; idea. I also really like the fact that I can leave GMail open in my browser all day and not have to repeatedly log in.

The best feature, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, has nothing to do with JavaScript. It&#8217;s the organization of e-mails into discussions. I really like being able to look back to previous e-mails that I replied to. I think the whole thing will fall apart, however, once you get an extremely long e-mail thread like those that tend to happen in business (sometimes 25-30 replies). But still, it&#8217;s the first change to the standard one-at-a-time e-mail paradigm that we&#8217;ve all been living in for the past decade or so.

Ultimately, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll make much use of GMail as I have enough e-mail accounts and I don&#8217;t feel like telling all my friends and family to switch my e-mail address again.
