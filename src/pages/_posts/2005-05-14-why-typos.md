As I&#8217;ve been reading through my own book (yes, I actually use it on a daily basis as reference), I&#8217;ve been finding typos here and there. I&#8217;ve also gotten a couple of e-mails pointing out other typos, and it really bums me out. Logically, writing over 600 pages without a mistake is probably not possible the first time around. But it still bothers me.

My initial reaction is: why didn&#8217;t the editors pick it up? Sure I wrote it, but there is a length review process before everything goes to print. The plain and simple fact is that proofreading a technical book is not so simple. You can&#8217;t accurately rely on Microsoft Word&#8217;s spell and grammar checking because of all the code that&#8217;s intermixed with regular text. The alternative is to have someone read it line by line and fix mistakes, but who has time for that?

I know a lot of the typos are related to either code examples or descriptions of code examples, but thankfully all of the sample code still works. All I can hope is that the book sells enough to warrant a second edition where I can fix these mistakes.

**Update:** Jim (my editor) takes some of the blame on <a title="Zakas Professional JavaScript Positive comments continue to roll in" rel="external" href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/2005/05/zakas_professio.html">his blog</a> for the technical editing mistakes. Like I said, I don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s any one person to blame, but it&#8217;s nice to know I&#8217;m not standing in front of the firing squad by myself. Thanks Jim. <img src="{{site.url}}/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
