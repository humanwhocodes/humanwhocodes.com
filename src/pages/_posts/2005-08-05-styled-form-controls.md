I finally took a look at the new <a title="Surfin' Safari" rel="external">Surfin&#8217; Safari blog</a> and was pretty excited about what I was seeing. Since the decision to move Apple WebKit into the open source arena, it seems like there&#8217;s been an explosion of innovation in the development of Safari. The one that really caught my eye was <a title="The New Form Controls: Checkbox" rel="external" href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/blog/?p=17">styling form controls</a>, which is coming in Safari.

I personally think it&#8217;s a very cool idea that can only improve usability, even though <a title="The New Form Controls: Checkbox - Comments" rel="external" href="http://webkit.opendarwin.org/blog/?p=17#comments">there are a few</a> who complain that it will hurt usability. I just don&#8217;t get it. I&#8217;d rather have someone style a traditional form control and have it work as expected rather than have someone hack together something that sort of works like a checkbox or radio button but isn&#8217;t accessible. Plus, the lack of ability to style form controls hasn&#8217;t exactly stopped people from coming up with wacky controls. I say onward with the styling revolution; let all controls be styled!
