Well, now you've all done it. My editor, <a title="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/minatel/" rel="external" href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com">Jim</a>, read the comments from my posting asking for book ideas. Now he wants me to write an entire book on <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">AJAX</acronym>! No rest for the weary.

So what I'm trying to do is flesh out an outline for the book, which will probably be 300-400 pages. Here's what I have so far:

  1. What is <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">AJAX</acronym>?
  2. <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">AJAX</acronym> Basics
  3. Practical <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">AJAX</acronym> (describing the gooey innards and browser compatibility)
  4. Case Study: An <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> Reader

I also figure I'll have the last chapter cover available <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">AJAX</acronym> frameworks that are out there, (<acronym title="Direct Web Remoting">DWR</acronym>, etc.).

If anyone has any other ideas for chapters or case studies (which are long projects that take up an entire chapter), please let add a comment to this post.

**Big News!** Got your attention? Good. I'm looking for a co-author (or two) to help write the book. If you think you've got what it takes (writing talent, a decent amount of free time, ability to take criticism, and a willingness to have your photo appear next to mine on the cover of a book). If you're interested, [Contact Me][1] directly (don't leave a post). When you contact me, please tell me why you'd be a good fit, what you'd like to write about, and include a writing sample (or a link to a writing sample).
