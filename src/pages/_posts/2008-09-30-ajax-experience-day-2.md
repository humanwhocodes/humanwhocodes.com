Today was the first day that I had a talk, but that didn&#8217;t make me any less lazy than normal. I dragged myself out of bed around 9:30am so that I could get down to the grand ballroom for the lightning talks. I thought this was a cool idea, having a bunch of people do five-minute presentations back-to-back. It went really well with only minor technical glitches here and there. Among those presenting were Yahoos Nicole Sullivan and Stoyan Stefanov who showed off their really cool new tool [Smush.It][1] which is an uber-image compression tool. Also involved was former Yahoo Bill Scott who showed some of the new Netflix APIs. It was a fun hour in a typically frigid ballroom.

After that, I went on a trek to find the nearest 7-11 to pick up some things I forgot to pack. It was a coolish day in Boston but it was a nice five minute walk around the waterfront. I then proceeded back to my room to work on my presentation before the talk. I&#8217;m glad I did this sanity check because I realized some of the examples weren&#8217;t quite formatted in an optimal way. I was able to change them and then take a nap (woohoo!) before my talk.

The talk, Test-Driven Development with YUI Test, was reasonably well attended and the crowd was pretty good. There were a lot of questions throughout, which is always good. Somehow I managed to keep proper time, both starting and finishing on time. For those who want the presentation and examples from the talk, you can download them [here][2].

After a brief conversation with Doug Crockford, Nicole Sullivan, Bill Scott, and Steve Souders, I headed back to my room to crash. All this traveling and excitement has really worn me out. Tonight will likely be low-key, dinner in the hotel and then probably a bit of time in the lounge before turning in. Can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s almost over!
