I&#8217;m always complaining about spam, having changed email addresses many times to try to escape, but I&#8217;ve never really understood the economics of spam all that well. Today I saw this <a title="Spamonomics 101" rel="external" href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/01/spamonomics_101.html">great post</a> explaining a little bit about why I get nonsensical emails seemingly selling nothing all the time: they&#8217;re poisoning the spam filters!

Personally, I think spammers should be taken out to a field and done away with old-west style, but at least now I understand a little bit more about how they operate. Seriously, read the post, it will open your eyes.
