I met Jackie somewhere around 10 years ago. She was in high school and I was in college. To be honest, I can&#8217;t remember why we started talking but I do remember us instantly getting along. Maybe it was our no-BS way of talking about anything and everything. It&#8217;s sometimes difficult to be friends with someone younger than you, especially at the high school/college age, but for some reason we just kept talking, keeping in touch, and hanging out.

"I&#8217;m never going to have a boyfriend," Jackie once proclaimed to me. She said it with a bit of despair. I, as the clearly older and wiser of the two (sarcasm), told her that I was sure she would be dating soon.

"I bet I won&#8217;t even have anyone to go to the prom with," she continued. Typical horror story for a high schooler, for sure.

"Look," I said, "I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have a boyfriend and then you&#8217;ll have someone to go the prom with. And hey, if you don&#8217;t, then I&#8217;ll take you."

Sure enough, Jackie did start dating someone not too long after our talk. Sadly, it ended before the prom and so one night I got a phone call from an uncharacteristically timid Jackie asking if my offer was still on the table. As a junior in college, the thought of going to a prom caused my stomach to turn. But I had given my word, so I went, hung out with her friends, and was the best prom date I could be. I was a bit of a mystery guy to her high school friends, but we all got along and had a pretty good time.

Not long after that, Jackie met Denis. I remember her telling me excitedly about this guy she had just met. From that moment, every conversation was dominated by the topic of Denis.

Yesterday, I watched Jackie and Denis get married in a beautiful, simple ceremony, surrounded by their friends and family, and ironically, many of the same people that were at the prom. It was the culmination of what most of us had assumed all along. It seemed funny, watching the girl that I had to reassure ten years ago about her dating life walk down the aisle to be married. It&#8217;s the first time that I can remember Jackie being completely still, quiet, and peaceful. She looked absolutely radiant and happy; I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s much else that you can wish someone on their wedding day.

So to Jackie, I have two things to say to you:

  1. I still have our prom picture proudly displayed in my office.
  2. I told you so.

Congratulations, Jackie and Denis! Best of luck and all the happiness in the world!
