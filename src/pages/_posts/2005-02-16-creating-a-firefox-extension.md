One of my latest projects is investigating <acronym title="XML User Interface Language">XUL</acronym> and how to create extensions to <a title="Mozilla" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. I came across a pretty in-depth <a title="Firefox Toolbar Tutorial" rel="external" href="http://www.borngeek.com/firefox/tutorial/">tutorial</a> that&#8217;s worth a read to anyone who wants to learn about that wacky Mozilla component architecture. It focuses on creating a new toolbar for Firefox, which seems to be pretty popular lately.
