Got an e-mail from <a title="BlakeMS.com" rel="external" href="http://www.blakems.com">Blake Scarbrough</a> this afternoon letting me know that he had reviewed my book on his site. The <a title="Javascript: no longer the ugly step-child" rel="external" href="http://www.blakems.com/archives/000128.html">review</a> is pretty positive, and he even makes reference to using the book in a manner similar to <a title="Google" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>. To me, that's one of the best compliments I can get (a sentiment that was echoed by <a title="Paul Whitrow" rel="external" href="http://www.pwhitrow">Paul Whitrow</a> on <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0764579088/ref=dp_nav_0/102-1328422-8355307?%5Fencoding=UTF8&n=507846&s=books">Amazon.com</a>).
