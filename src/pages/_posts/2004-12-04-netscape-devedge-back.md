In an odd turn of events, <a title="Netscape DevEdge" rel="external" href="http://devedge.netscape.com">Netscape Devedge</a> is back online. I was doing more research for my book and followed a link on another page. I got about halfway through reading the first paragraph when I realized the article resided on DevEdge. Low and behold, the site is back! Of course, not in time for me to use it on the chapter of my book I just finished, but I'm very happy to have this great resource back.
