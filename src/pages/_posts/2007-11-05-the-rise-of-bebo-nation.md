My buddy <a title="Adam Platti" rel="external" href="http://www.adamplatti.net">Adam Platti</a> has been working on a stealth project over at <a title="Bebo" rel="external" href="http://www.bebo.com">Bebo</a> for a while now, and today his work has officially launched. Check out <a title="Bebo Nation" rel="external" href="http://www.bebonation.com">Bebo Nation</a>.

<a title="Mashable!" rel="external" href="http://mashable.com">Mashable!</a>, the only other company that includes an exclamation point as part of their name, has a <a title="Bebo Nation Launches: Million Dollar Homepage on a Map?" rel="external" href="http://mashable.com/2007/11/05/bebo-nation/">nice writeup about it</a>. The basic idea is to overlay the <a title="Million Dollar Homepage" rel="external" href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Homepage</a> and overlay it on a map. Bebo members can by specific areas on the map to put up whatever they&#8217;d like (for a price, of course). I think it&#8217;s an interesting attempt at pure monetization of a social network, and I know Adam has put a lot of hard work into it (hell, he even dusted off his C skills). It will be interesting to see how Bebo Nation developers and if it can sustain its early momentum. Congrats Adam!
