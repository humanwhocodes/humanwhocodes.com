# Donate

Thanks for your interest in supporting my work. All of my writing (both blog posts and books), as well as my [open source work](https://github.com/nzakas), is done without direct financial support. I don't charge for the content on this site and my last book, <cite><a href="https://leanpub.com/understandinges6">Understanding ECMAScript 6</a></cite>, was published in full for free online. This work takes a lot of time, and your donation will allow me to spend even more time creating the content people enjoy and working on open source projects that help people do their jobs.

I don't have a full-time job, so your donation is greatly appreciated.
