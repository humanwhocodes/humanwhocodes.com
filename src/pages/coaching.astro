                <h2>Why Coaching Matters</h2>
                <p>I remember the first time someone told me what it took to get promoted to principal engineer. "At a certain point," he said, "you stop being judged on your technical skills and start being judged on how you work with people." This surprised me. When I began my career as a software engineer, no one ever told me I'd need to do anything other than write code, let alone that I'd have to become good at working with people!</p>
                
                <p>Not everyone is as lucky as me, to have had a mentor who could articulate what it takes to succeed in the upper levels of the independent contributor track. As your coach, I look to fulfill that role for you. My job is to help you work through the leadership, organization, and communication challenges of your work; to help you discover what you're passionate about; to achieve that next-level promotion; or to strategize about implementing your vision.</p>

I could not have made this transition so successfully -- from individual contributor to technical lead and eventually manager & CEO -- without his help. Nicholas' insight and experience was invaluable, and helped me become a more effective technical leader to my team."</p>

                <h2>About Your Coach</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Nicholas Zakas. I've been a software engineer for over 16 years, and I've worked at all kinds of companies from a tiny, bootstrapped startup to a multinational corporation. I've worked at companies in Massachusetts and California. I've worked on small teams and led distributed teams in multiple countries. I've worked as a consultant with multiple companies both on-site and remotely.</p>
                
                <p>I've been at a company that shut down completely and survived multiple rounds of layoffs at two other companies. I've been through two IPOs (one in Massachusetts, one in Silicon Valley). I've been an architect at two companies in Silicon Valley. I've published several well-reviewed programming <a href="/books">books</a> and <a href="/speaking">spoken</a> at software conferences around the world. I've started an <a href="https://eslint.org">open source project</a> that has millions of daily downloads.</p>
                
                <p>I bring this wide range of experience with me into our conversations to not just explain how I approach things but to help find the approach that works best for you.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"I hired Nicholas to coach two of our most senior engineers. His insight, feedback, and guidance helped both of them produce higher-quality work, raise their impact across the org, and attain promotions."</p>

            <section class="coaching-section">
                <h2>How I Work</h2>
                <p>I work with current and aspiring tech leads, staff+ engineers, architects, and CTOs to become more effective and productive technical leaders. We will meet remotely for 50 minutes either every week or every other week for at least 12 weeks and discover the best way to work with each other. In between these calls, you'll have access to a private Slack channel for any questions that come up.</p>
                
                <p>The coaching program is guided by you. I'll ask you to come into each call prepared with what you'd like to discuss. If you have specific goals, we'll work on identifying and navigating next steps; if you don't have specific goals, we'll work on defining them. We will discuss tactics and strategies, both in service of achieving your goals and sometimes to help deal with situations in real time.</p>
                
                <p>I prefer to work directly with your employer, which makes it easier to talk about information that may be covered by NDAs. I encourage you to discuss with your manager if you have a professional development budget to apply towards coaching. If working with your employer is not an option, then I also work directly with individuals and make sure to keep our discussions at such a level that they do not conflict with NDAs.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"I was looking to improve my leadership skills and from the moment I met Nicholas I felt confident that he could help me to achieve this. Throughout all 6 sessions I felt at ease and in the lead as to what to discuss. As a result, I was able to better deal with difficult conversations at work, while still staying true to myself. Seldom I've met people that leave such a big impact on my life, thank you Nicholas!"</p>

                <h2>Coaching Tracks</h2>
                <p>Depending on your goals, you may want to choose one of my coaching tracks. These tracks cover common problems that face more experienced software engineers.</p>
                
                <ul class="coaching-tracks">
                    <li><strong>Productivity & Time Management</strong> — If you feel like you never have enough time to do everything that is expected of you, then this is the track for you. We'll look at how you spend your time and come up with strategies for optimizing your approach. Our goal is get you accomplishing everything you need to do within 40 hours each week.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Leadership & Influence</strong> — Leadership is a big part of higher-level individual contributor roles, but how do you lead without any actual authority? On this track, you'll learn how to exert influence over your peers and manager to get things done in a respectful, conscious way.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Getting Promoted</strong> — Choose this track if your primary goal is promotion to the next level of your company's individual contributor track. We will work with your company's career ladder to turn the listed expectations into actionable advice.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Career Development</strong> — Should stay an IC or switch to management? As a staff engineer, do you want to focus narrowly or broadly? Would speaking or writing improve your career trajectory? If you're not quite sure what the next step in your career should be, this track will help.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Open Source Kickstart</strong> — Launching an open source project can do wonders for your personal or company brand, but doing it badly can also hurt. If you need help planning an open source launch and have questions about licenses, managing contributors, and growing a community, then this is the track for you.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Choose Your Own Adventure</strong> — If none of the previous tracks align with the help you need, we can design a track just for you. During our free intake conversation, we'll discuss your goals and challenges, and come up with a plan to address them.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p>"Nicholas has significantly accelerated my growth and happiness as a software engineer by helping me set and achieve goals that take me in the direction I want to go. His experience has also been invaluable when facing new and challenging situations in the upper echelons of the IC engineer track such as leadership skills, giving feedback, working with executives, finding high leverage work, and making the best use of limited time. Coaching with Nicholas isn't just about following a playbook and hoping for the best. He provides specifically tailored practical guidance combined with feedback and accountability. Nicholas is the real deal!"</p>

                    <p>"Nicholas' coaching program completely changed my perspective on how I develop software and advance in my career. I came to his program with over 10 years of software development experience yet stagnant in my career. Nicholas pointed me in the right direction and gave me tips on how to have better focus, excel at tasks, and advance at my company. I look forward to working with him more and encourage others to do the same."</p>

                <h2>What Happens During a Call</h2>
                <p>I'll ask you to come into each call with one to three topics to discuss. These topics need not be very specific, so there's no need to stress about perfect wording or the depth of the topic. Whatever is foremost on your mind is a great jumping-off point for discussion.</p>
                
                <p>As your coach, I don't have any agenda other than to help you achieve your goals. I will listen closely to what you tell me and keep everything in strict confidence. You can depend on me to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create a safe environment</strong> where we can explore your ideas together</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask thoughtful questions</strong> to clarify the situation and help you better define the problem or goal</li>
                    <li><strong>Help you find your solutions</strong> that work best for you, not necessarily what I would do</li>
                    <li><strong>Share experience and perspective</strong> on what I and others have experienced in similar situations</li>
                    <li><strong>Support your growth</strong> and help you recover from disappointments</li>
                    <li><strong>Suggest resources</strong> and thought experiments to help you grow and gain additional perspectives</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"As a staff engineer at a startup, I juggle numerous responsibilities and am often pulled in many different directions. Nicholas played a crucial role in helping me navigate these challenges, drawing on his extensive experience and coaching background to give me unbiased feedback and guidance. He also assisted me in identifying and pursuing the aspects of my work that I enjoy the most, while still being a valuable and effective contributor to my company. I highly recommend him to fellow senior engineers and look forward to working with him again soon!"</p>
