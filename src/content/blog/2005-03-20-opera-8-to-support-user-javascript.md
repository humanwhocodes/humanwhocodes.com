Seems like it was only yesterday that I first read about <a title="GreaseMonkey" rel="external" href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a> for <a title="Mozilla Firefox" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox">Firefox</a>, which allows developers to write their own JavaScript to insert into specific Web sites that they visit. Now comes the news that Opera 8 will <a title="Opera 8 beta 3 introduces User JavaScript" rel="external" href="http://my.opera.com/hallvors/journal/44">support user JavaScript</a>, essentially the same thing.

Though the post claims the idea isn't directly related to GreaseMonkey, it seems unlikely that the idea to introduce this feature now isn't in some way reflecting the popularity of GreaseMonkey. Just one more thing Internet Explorer will have to catch up on&#8230;
