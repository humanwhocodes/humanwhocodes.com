After months of quiet, <a title="Surfin' Safari" rel="external" href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/">Dave Hyatt</a>, developer of Apple's Safari browser, has been on quite the blog-roll lately (get it?). His <a title="Safari 1.3" rel="external" href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/hyatt/archives/2005_04.html#007962">latest entry</a> details enhancements to Safari 1.3, and I'm pretty excited to see both the `contentEditable` and `designMode` properties are now supported. Additionally, most of <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> 2 is now supported and exposed to the JavaScript layer. Also very cool is the addition of <acronym title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations">XSLT</acronym> support, though Hyatt doesn't go too deep into the level of support (at the JavaScript level, or only when loading <acronym title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</acronym> documents?). Too bad the `XMLHttpRequest` object still doesn't quite work right. But I don't know, it's starting to look like a Mac Mini may be in my future.
