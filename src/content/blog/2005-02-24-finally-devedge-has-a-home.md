After months of wondering, it was <a rel="external" href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/mitchell/archives/2005/02/devmo_and_deved.html">announced</a> that the <a title="Mozilla" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> has come to an agreement with <a title="America Online" rel="external" href="http://www.aol.com">America Online</a> in regards to the old Netscape DevEdge documentation and Web site.

Deb Richardson will now head up the new DevMo project, whose purpose is to build upon the excellent DevEdge resources to create a place for Mozilla documentation. While it's unclear when the original information will be posted again, we can all rest easy knowing that the content hasn't been lost and will be made available as soon as possible. Score one for Mozilla.
