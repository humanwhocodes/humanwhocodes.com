Came across some interesting information today regarding Internet Explorer's problems with circular references and memory cleanup. The problems with <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>&#8216;s JavaScript memory handling have been talked about frequently, but <a title="IE: where's my memory?" rel="external" href="http://www.bazon.net/mishoo/articles.epl?art_id=824">this article</a> explains a very interesting phenomenon. I really can't add anything to the discussion than to see this is a must-read.
