No, I'm not talking about the JavaScript library called IE7, but rather Internet Explorer, version 7, is on its way. <a title="Reversal: Next IE update divorced from Windows" rel="external" href="http://news.com.com/Reversal+Next+IE+update+divorced+from+Windows/2100-1032_3-5577263.html?tag=nl">An announcement</a> was made today indicating that not only will the next version of Internet Explorer *not* wait for Longhorn, but a test version should arrive this summer.

Of course, no one knows what this new version will bring. Has Microsoft really had time to look into fixing the standards problems they have? And why will this browser only be available to those using Windows XP Service Pack 2? What about all the other users? This will certainly be interesting.

In the meantime, thank <a title="Mozilla Firefox" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> for putting a little pressure on Microsoft to try to maintain its market share.
