I don't often blog about work, but in this case, I'm making an exception. Today is my last day at MatrixOne as I have accepted a position at <a title="VistaPrint" rel="external" href="http://www.vistaprint.com">VistaPrint</a>. It's going to be a tough transition since I've worked with some of the people at MatrixOne for about five years, and I'm going to a company where I don't know anybody. However, I felt that this decision was best for my personal career growth. I look forward to the new challenges that will await me at VistaPrint and wish MatrixOne the best of luck in all of their future endeavors.
