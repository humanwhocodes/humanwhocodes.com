I don't often stop by the IEBlog to read the latest posts, mostly because there's been nothing interesting to read until recently. The <a title="IE and Standards" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/03/09/391362.aspx">latest post</a> asked for feedback on what standards and features the proposed Internet Explorer version 7 should support. As usual at the IEBlog, the comments ranged from <a title="re: IE and Standards" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/03/09/391362.aspx#391968">useful</a> to <a title="re: IE and Standards" rel="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/03/09/391362.aspx#391420">useless</a> (part of the reason I don't visit that often).

In any event, it seems pretty clear what Web developers would like to see in the next version of <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>. The most often cited is full <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>2 support, full support of <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> 4.01, and full support of <acronym title="eXtensible Hyper Text Markup Language">XHTML</acronym> 1.0 or 1.1. Others also suggested supporting the <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</acronym> event model, which I would personally love.

Unfortunately, I just can't bring myself to read all of the comments on IEBlog, there's too much flaming and arguing back and forth about how Microsoft is ignoring the developers and they're evil and egomaniacal. Just goes to prove that Web browsers have ignited what amounts to a religious war among developers, and this war unfolds daily on IEBlog. Such a shame, Microsoft finally reaches out to the development community and we thank them by pointing fingers.
