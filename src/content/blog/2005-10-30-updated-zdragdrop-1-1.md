I've received a couple of e-mails in the past week from people trying to use zDragDrop with a strict doctype. Apparently, I forgot to add the &#8220;px&#8221; on a couple of style measurements and that was causing the library to fail when using a strict doctype. So, I just quickly updated zDragDrop to include this fix (thanks to Pawan and Alan for pointing it out). This updated version is available in the <a title="Downloads" rel="internal" href="/downloads">Downloads</a> section.
