Did anyone notice that <a title="Netscape 8" rel="external" href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape 8</a> was released today? Anyone? Yeah, didn't think so. If it wasn't for a little blurb I picked up on a message board, I probably wouldn't have even noticed.

My question to Netscape is: why? No one cares about you anymore, and version 8 of the browser doesn't suck any less than the beta that was released a few months ago. It still has too much stuff front-and-center, making the browser a distraction from the content it's supposed to be serving. Yeah, the feature to view as Firefox or Internet Explorer is nice, but hardly useful for the casual Web surfer. I just don't see why anyone would rather use Netscape 8 than Firefox.
