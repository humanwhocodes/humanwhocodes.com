Just got pinged by my editor <a title="Jim Minatel Wrox Book Editor Blog" rel="external" href="http://wroxblog.typepad.com/">Jim</a> about this: <a title="Best Books of 2006 - Top 10 Editors' Picks: Computers & Internet" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/1000020581/">Top 10 Editors' Picks: Computers & Internet</a>. If you scroll down to #8, you'll see <a title="Professional Ajax" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=nczonline-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F0471777781%2F">Professional Ajax</a>!

Words can't describe how excited I am about this. To be on this list is amazing, and the fact that it's the only Ajax book on the list makes it even more impressive. I wish there was a small writeup to describe why each book was chosen, but still, this is an incredible honor, and one that wouldn't have been possible without my co-authors <a title="XWeb" rel="external" href="http://www.wdonline.com">Jeremy</a> and <a title="Joe asks 'Is it me or what?'" rel="external" href="http://joef.typepad.com">Joe</a>. Everyone worked really hard on this, and this honor really is a payoff for all that work.
