Even with 10 million downloads, <a title="Mozilla Firefox" rel="external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox">Firefox</a> could gain another 80,000 downloads the next few weeks as <a title="Penn State Tells 80,000 Students To Chuck IE" rel="external" href="https://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=55301109">Penn State has asked all students and staff to switch from IE</a> to an alternative browser such as Firefox, Mozilla, Opera, or Safari for security reasons.

Who knows, if this type of negative publicity continues, Microsoft may be forced to do something about IE.
