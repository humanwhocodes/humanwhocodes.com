For the longest time, I have fought off the urge to join [Twitter][1]. My online footprint is fairly large and I just can't devote enough time to update everything in every place that I exist on the wonderful web. However, I saw something pop up that I had to respond to, and thus, I have signed up for Twitter. I'll give it a shot for a bit and see what happens. If you're interested in cyberstalking me, follow me here: [@slicknet][2].
