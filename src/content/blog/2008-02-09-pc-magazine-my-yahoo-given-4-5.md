In what will hopefully be the first of many positive reviews this year, <a title="My Yahoo!" rel="external" href="http://my.yahoo.com">My Yahoo!</a> was given a 4-out-of-5 rating in a <a title="My Yahoo! Review" rel="external" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2255785,00.asp">PC Magazine review</a>. The review, which came out today, makes comparisons against what are perceived to be the two biggest competitors: Netvibes and PageFlakes. The old My Yahoo! seemed to get a little long in the tooth as Netvibes and PageFlakes seemed to recreate the idea of a personalized homepage. How about the new My Yahoo!? The review says:

> All of this suggests that My Yahoo! has mostly caught up with and in some cases even surpassed the newcomers, as far as module choice and presentation go.

Additionally, it looks like all of the performance work we've done in the past few months has paid off, as the review specifically mentions the speed with which the page loads:

> In general, My Yahoo! loads faster than its Web 2.0 competitors Netvibes and Pageflakes&#8230;

I've said this before, but if you haven't tried the new My Yahoo! yet, now is probably a good time. Our team has been working very hard to make this the best personalized start page on the Internet. It looks like PC Magazine noticed, what do you think?
