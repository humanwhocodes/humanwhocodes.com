Following up on my promise to provide more useful JavaScript on this site, I'd like to introduce zInherit 1.0. This handy little library helps to make multiple inheritance easier in JavaScript, allowing you to continue using the class prototype inheritance methodology with a new twist.

I also updated zEvents to allow for usage by ECMAScript Edition 1 implementations (the previous one assumed ECMAScript Edition 3).

Both libraries, licensed under the <acronym title="Lesser General Public License">LGPL</acronym>, are currently available in <a rel="internal" href="https://humanwhocodes.com/downloads/">Downloads</a>.
