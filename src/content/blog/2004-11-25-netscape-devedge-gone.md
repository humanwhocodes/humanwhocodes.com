Apparently, Netscape's DevEdge site (previously at https://devedge.netscape.com) has been taken down. This was one of the great Web developer resources, containing all kinds of great code examples, explanations, and other interesting Web-related content.

While researching for my book, I used DevEdge a lot in the early months, but hadn't tried to access it again until today. Come to find out it's been gone for nearly a month. What a sad, sad turn of events, especially given that the content isn't available anywhere else and <a href="https://www.google.com" title="Google" rel="external">Google</a> doesn't seem to have it cached.
