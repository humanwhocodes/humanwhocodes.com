It seems like all the cool development tools are for <a title="Mozilla Firefox" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> these days. Anyone who has tried to develop for <a rel="Apple Safari" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">Safari</a> knows the pain of debugging due to lack of good development tools. It appears that this is just about to change.

My buddy Keith hit me up with a link to <a title="Xyle Scope" rel="external" href="http://www.culturedcode.com/xyle/">Xyle Scope</a>, a Safari add-on that gives you unconditional access to any page's <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> and <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> information. You can edit <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</acronym> code on the fly and see your changes applied instantly, as well as take a trip through the source code to see how a page is layed out. Hopefully this is just the beginning of good development tools for Safari!
