Every once in a while I come across a JavaScript creation, utility, or tool and I wonder, &#8220;how did I not know this existed?&#8221; I mean, I've worked with JavaScript on a daily basis for four years and still I find stuff online that I've never seen before. Today's discovery: <a title="jsLint" rel="external" href="https://www.crockford.com/javascript/lint.html">JSLint</a>.

As the author, <a title="Douglas Crockford's Wrrrld Wide Web" rel="external" href="https://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>, says:

> When C was a young programming language, there were several common programming errors that were not caught by the primitive compilers, so an accessory program called lint was developed which would scan a source file, looking for problems&#8230;A lint for JavaScript is needed.

JSLint is essentially a tool that looks for common problems in JavaScript and spits out an error report. The fascinating part of it (to me, at least) is that JSLint is actually written in JavaScript, which basically means that it is a JavaScript parser written in JavaScript&#8230;how cool is that? I truly commend Douglas for making such a useful tool, I'll be using it often from now on.
