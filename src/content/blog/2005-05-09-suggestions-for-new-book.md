Well, the ink on <a title="Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" rel="external" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764579088/qid=1105481108/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-9733195-7492141?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Professional JavaScript</a> isn't yet dry and I've already been asked to write another JavaScript book for <a title="Wrox Press" rel="external" href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox</a>. This new book is going to be project-based, showing how to design a particular piece of functionality from start to finish. So the question I'm posing to all of you is this: what sort of projects would you like to see? So far, I've come up with the following:

  * Expanding/Collapsing Tree
  * Cascading Menus
  * Toolbars
  * Rich Text Editor
  * Autosuggest Textbox
  * Highlight/Linkify Text (such as highlighting Google search terms on the page)

I need to have between 10 and 15 projects to make this work, so if you have any ideas, please post them to this entry.
