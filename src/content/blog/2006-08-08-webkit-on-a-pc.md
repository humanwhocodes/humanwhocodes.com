There's been whispers about this for a while, but it looks like some people actually got their act together and decided to go for it. Now, you can get a WebKit-based browser for the PC: <a title="GetWebKit" rel="external" href="http://www.getwebkit.org/">GetWebKit</a>.

The browser's actual name is Swift, and is based off of Apple's WebKit (the same technology behind Safari). I haven't had a chance to play around with it yet, and apparently there are some quirks, but at least it's a nice step in the right direction.
