Trying to get a book out is a lot of work and trying to coordinate everything and write takes a lot of energy. It's been fun, but a lot of work, and I decided that I needed a break. So when [Steve Souders][2] first approached me to write for his new book, <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596522304?ie=UTF8&tag=nczonline-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0596522304">Even Faster Web Sites</a></cite>, I was hesitant. After talking with him, he just wanted a single chapter and the idea of being a contributor rather than &#8220;the man&#8221; really grew on me.

<cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596522304?ie=UTF8&tag=nczonline-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0596522304">Even Faster Web Sites</a></cite> is a continuation of Steve's work from his first book, <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596529309?ie=UTF8&tag=nczonline-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0596529309">High Performance Web Sites</a></cite>, and focuses on more information for front end engineers looking to improve web performance. There's a lot more focus on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in this book than in the first.

This is the first book that I've worked on as a contributor, and it's great to be joined by some of the best in the business who also contributed: [Douglas Crockford][3], [Stoyan Stefanov][4], [Nicole Sullivan][5], [ Dylan Schiemann][6], Tony Gentilcore, [Dion Almaer][7], and [Ben Galbraith][8].

My chapter is entitled, <cite>Writing Efficient JavaScript</cite>, and it contains a lot of tidbits about JavaScript performance that you may not know (unless you read my blog regularly, of course). In writing this chapter, I did a lot of performance research across all major browser to really isolate the issues that slow JavaScript execution down. There's a ton of details that I only had time to do because this chapter was my only priority &#8211; quite a difference from writing an entire book.

Steve was quite happy with my material and so invited me to a workshop, also entitled [Writing Efficient JavaScript][9], at the [Velocity][10] conference in June. I hope to see you there. (Psst..you can get a 15% discount on registration by using the code **vel09fsp**. Consider it my gift to you.)

I want to thank Steve for the opportunity to work with him and this ultra-talented group of people. I'm very excited about the prospects for this book, which should be another &#8220;must-have&#8221; for serious web developers.
