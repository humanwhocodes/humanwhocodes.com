Well it had to happen at some point, someone who adequately named himself/herself &#8220;Anonymous Coward&#8221; left a single-star review on Amazon about my book. My apparent discretion? I appear to have incorrectly stated that comments in JavaScript are the same as Java, C, and Perl. The commenter correctly points out that Perl comments begin with a pound sign (#). I went back and re-read the section in question, and alas, there is the mistake. I know what I was thinking when I wrote it&#8230;I was thinking <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> but wrote Perl.

Hey, I'm human, I can admit I made a mistake. And I suppose if that's the one thing this person hated in my book, then I'm doing pretty damn well. I just think it's pretty lousy to beat up my Amazon rating because of such a small error. It's not like I said that Netscape is the dominant browser and C code can be accessed from JavaScript.

Those who know me know that I'm very open to criticisms and corrections. But if there's an error in the book, please either <a title="Contact Me" rel="internal" href="/contact/">contact me</a> or file an <a title="Incident Report" rel="external" href="http://support.wiley.com/customer/content/incident.aspx">incident</a> with Wrox to report the error. In this way, I can make sure that the appropriate notices get posted on the Wrox Web site and that if there's a second edition, I can fix the problem.
