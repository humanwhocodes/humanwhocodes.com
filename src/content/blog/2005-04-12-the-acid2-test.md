Way back when, there was an <a title="CSS Acid Test" rel="external" href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec5526c.htm">Acid test</a> for testing <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> box model implementations in browsers. This simple test was used by browser developers to ensure proper alignment with appropriate standards.

Now, the <a title="Web Standards Project" rel="external" href="http://www.webstandards.org">Web Standards Project</a> has introduced the second generation, the <a title="Acid2 Test" rel="external" href="http://webstandards.org/act/acid2/">Acid2 Test</a>, to further help browser makers tackle proper <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, <acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym>, and <acronym title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</acronym> implementations, among other things. It really is an ingenius little page, make sure you read the <a title="Acid2: the guided tour" rel="external" href="http://webstandards.org/act/acid2/guide.html">description</a> of how the page is constructed.
