I came across <a title="Google Search Enhanced for Firefox" rel="external" href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6310">this article</a> explaining how Google has started using link prefetching in an effort to speed up the search site. When using <a title="Mozilla Firefox" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox">Firefox</a> (or any other Mozilla browser), Google now prefetches the first result in the list. As <a title="Results Prefetching" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#prefetch">they explain it</a>, this means if you click on the first result that the page will come up faster because it has already begun downloading.

Mozilla has a <a title="Link Prefetching FAQ" rel="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/Link_Prefetching_FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> document providing all of the details about link prefetching.
