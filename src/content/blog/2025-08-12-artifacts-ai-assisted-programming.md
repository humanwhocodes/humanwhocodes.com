A lot of the hype around AI-assisted programming is focused on "vibe coding," which is working prompt by prompt to build up an application and not worrying too much about the generated code. As long as something works, that's all that matters. While this is a fun approach for personal and hobby projects, it is impractical in professional software engineering.

Professional software engineering is marked by a team of developers working on a common codebase that is maintained over time. As such, there are concerns that go beyond whether or not the code is working. Significant changes need to be documented to provide traceability when something goes wrong. *Traceability* is the ability to look through changes and track them back to the root, whether that be a bug fix or a requirements change or a new feature. Understanding why a change was made, especially one that caused a problem, is important for maintaining an application over time. That's why professional software organizations prioritize the creation of artifacts as the application changes.

## What are artifacts?

An *artifact* is some output that is created, used, or modified during the software development process. Issues and pull requests are artifacts, as are diagrams, documents, mockups, and the code itself.




* Product design documents
* Technical specifications
* Decision documents
