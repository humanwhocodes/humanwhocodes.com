I've been messing around with some old JavaScript code I found recently. The basic idea was to create a way to convert colors from <acronym title="Red-Green-Blue">RGB</acronym> to <acronym title="Hue-Saturation-Luminance">HSL</acronym> and back again in order to create color effects like gradients using JavaScript. <acronym title="Hue-Saturation-Luminance">HSL</acronym> is better suited to many color manipulations, but it's not supported by <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>. So, I started dabbling around with color conversion algorithms until I got it close enough to the results of graphic programs. I cleaned up the code a bit and threw in some more functionality. The result, zColor, is now available on the <a title="Downloads" rel="internal" href="/downloads/">Downloads</a> page. I haven't had the time to type up documentation, but the code comments and example are pretty self-explanatory. I've labeled this version 0.1, since it's definitely a work in progress, but feel free to play around with it and use it if you find it useful.
