Finally back home after my trip to Boston. It was a little weird, I felt like I really wasn't there for all that long because my typical trips back to Boston involve meeting up with friends and family every day. Since I was at the Ajax Experience for most of the time, it seemed to go by much faster. Also reminded me what I love Massachusetts and everything about it (including the bad drivers).

I put my presentations up on Slideshare for everyone to view. They were actually on the spotlight for a day as well:

  * [Enterprise JavaScript Error Handling][1]
  * [Test Driven Development with YUI Test][2]

My talks certainly weren't the &#8220;sexy&#8221; ones of the conference; those are typically the ones centered around popular or upcoming JavaScript frameworks. However, I did get a lot of positive feedback about the content and I really hope that people learned a thing or two.
