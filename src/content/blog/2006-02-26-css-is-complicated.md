Being a <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> expert wherever I've worked, I always thought that it was pretty easy. This week, I'm supposed to be giving a presentation on <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, so I've been working on putting together the Powerpoint slides this weekend. As I've been doing this I realized, <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> is really complicated!

I currently have 40 slides and I know there's a bunch of stuff I'm missing. But how can you decide what the most important parts of <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> are when you have only an hour to tell people everything they've ever wanted to know about it?
