The <a title="Creating an Autosuggest Textbox with JavaScript, Part 2" rel="external" href="http://webreference.com/r/pg/javascript/ncz/column2/">second part</a> of my three-part series on how to create an autosuggest textbox (to emulate <a title="Google Suggest" rel="external" href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a>) is now up on WebReference. I got a lot of positive feedback on the first part, and I hope everyone enjoys this one just as much.
