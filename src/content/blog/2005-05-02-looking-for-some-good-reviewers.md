Well, the book has been released and the only thing left to do is&#8230;get it professionally reviewed. If you are a reviewer for a Web development Web site or magazine, please contact me! I'm looking for people to give an honest review, especially on &#8220;geek&#8221; sites. I can provide reviewers with complimentary copies of the book. Serious inquiries only please!
